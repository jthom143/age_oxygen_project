Scientific Programme and MethodsDESCRIPTION OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMThe object of this cruise was to occupy a series of CTD-O2 (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth-Oxygen) stations along two, approximately north-south tracks.The first track started at 30°S. 95°E and ended at the edge of the ice ofAntarctica at 82°E.  The second track began at the ice edge at 111°E andproceeded north to the continental shelf of Australia at 115°E.This collection of high-quality water-property data will help define the patternof circulation in the Indian Ocean. At each station measurements of temperature,salinity, and dissolved-oxygen concentration were made continuously with depth,and the concentrations of dissolved silica, phosphate, nitrate, and nitrite weremeasured at up to 36 discrete levels. In addition, measurements of freon, tritium concentrations and CO2 were made at selected levels. The station spacingranged from 5 to 40 nautical miles, and all flowerings were made to within 10-20m of the bottom.  Continuous echo-sounding was maintained along the cruise track,as well as ADCP current measurements.OBSERVATIONS AND SAMPLESThe beginning, bottom and end positions of all the CTD stations occupied on thiscruise are listed in the attached table, with the stations numbered sequentiallythrough the cruise.  Positions are also shown on the attached chart.  Weanticipate completion of the calibration and editing of the various data by 1August 1996.  As the hydrographic data for this section are WOCE data, the datathen move through an additional quality-evaluation stage managed by the WOCEHydrographic Programme Office (WHPO) in Woods Hole, which is generally expectedto be completed within two years of cruise end and which includes the formalissuing (by WHPO) of a final ship-based data report about one year after thecruise end; and a final ship-and shore-based data report about two years afterthe cruise end.As this is the most intensive phase of WOCE, the timing of these reports isquite approximate due to the heavy workload of the technical groups making themeasurements and doing the quality control assessments.  With that in mind, weintend to issue to Australia the preliminary version that results from thecalibration and editing phase in mid 1996, and subsequently issue revisionsshould the latter WHPO process lead to alterations.  The data will be in digitalform on 9-track magnetic tape, or other suitable media; and the final reportwill be printed copy and/or a text file.A.5.  Major Problems and Goals not AchievedA.6.

EQUIPMENT CONFIGURATIONEquipment used aboard the R/V Knorr for WOCE section I8SI9S was provided by bothWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution CTD Operations (WHOI CTD Ops) and theScripps Institute of Oceanography's Shipboard Technical Services/ Ocean DataFacility (SIO STS/ODF). A total of 147 stations were taken during the cruise.Two complete sampler frames were provided by ODF, each consisting of a coatedaluminum frame and thirty-six ODF-built 10-liter bottles. For this cruise twoCTDs were usually attached to the frame, one providing real-time data via FSKtelemetry, and another recording internally. Also mounted on the frame were a GOpylon, independent ocean temperature modules (OTM), a lowered acoustic dopplercurrent profiler (LADCP) provided by the University of Hawaii, and an OceanInstruments System's 12 kHz pinger for bottom-finding. 141 of the 147 CTDstation data came from WHOI CTD 9, a WHOI-modified Neil Brown MK-3b CTD,sampling at 23.8 Hz, and incorporating a Sensormedics oxygen sensor assembly, atitanium strain gauge pressure tranducer and a platinum temperature sensor witha lag of 150 ms.A General Oceanics (GO) model 1016-36 position pylon was mounted to the 36-bottle frame to control the firing of the bottles at depth. The 1016 pylon wasdriven by a GO 1016-SCI Surface Control Interface (SCI) in the lab, whichprovided power and commands down the sea cable, and received status data back.The SCI was controlled through a dedicated personal computer. Due to SCIperformance problems, the 1016-36 pylon was replaced with two GO 1015-24 pylonsmounted one on top of the other. The 1015-24 pylons were controlled by two GO1015PM deck units, which provided power and commands down the cable.One of two Falmouth Scientific CTDs, ICTD1338 and ICTD1344, were placed on theprimary frame in internal-recording mode to acquire comparison data. Inaddition, one of two Falmouth Scientific OTMs were placed on the frame toprovide an independent temperature measurement channel in the CTD data stream.During rough weather a smaller specially-designed stainless steel frame wasused. The frame was built at WHOI and is based on a design from John Bullister'sgroup at NOAA/PMEL, uses 25 4-liter sample bottles, and is intended to provideCTD capability in high seas.  Five stations were taken with this frame using a1015-24 pylon and WHOI CTD 12, a GO-upgraded MK3c CTD sampling at 25.0 Hz, aSensormedics oxygen sensor assembly, a titanium pressure transducer, a platinumtemperature sensor with a lag of 200ms, and a fast thermistor.EQUIPMENT PROBLEMSStations 1-3 were test stations. Station 1 used ICTD1338, with the 1016-36 pylonand SCI.  Numerous problems were encountered including communicationinterferences between the fsk ICTD data and the pylon-SCI communication.  It wasalso found that the oxygen sensor was not working properly and it was deducedafter the cruise that the SeaCon underwater connectors were failing open-circuitat various pressures.Station 2 used CTD9, 1016 SCI and pylon, and again communication problemsdeveloped causing synch errors in the CTD data and unreliable operation of thepylon.  The oxygen assembly on CTD9 was not secured properly thus not recordingreliable oxygen data.  Station 3 used CTD12 and the 1016-36 pylon and SCI, andagain the cast had communication interference between the SCI and the CTD.Efforts were made to adjust the telemetry levels to minimize the datadisruption.For stations 4 and 5, CTD9 was used with the 1016 SCI and pylon, againcommunication problems were noted.  During the down cast the pylon was turned off and only turned on during the upcast.  The acquisition program was placed instand-by when firing bottles because the CTD data had unacceptably high errorrates when the pylon was used.After station 5, the 1016-36 position pylon was removed from the frame andreplaced with a GO 1015-24 position pylon.  For station 6 through station 29 only 24 bottles were tripped, as only one 24-position pylon was able to be used.  For station 30, a second 24-position pylon was stacked underneath the first,providing the capability to trigger all 36 sample bottles.On numerous occasions, data reported by the FSI OTM would indicate a data latch-up, sometimes accompanied by a subsequent restart.  The problem was not solved on the cruise, but was later traced to insufficient clearances of the internalcomponents in the pressure case.The three GO 1016-36 pylons which were initially tried all failed.  Two failureswere traced to damaged internal power supplies, and one had a broken position-indicating switch.  All pylons were initially supplied in fully tested andsatisfactory condition, but it was later found that using them with the GO-supplied SCIs could cause the power supply failures.  We have since stopped using the GO-supplied SCIs.  The mechanical failure to the position switch caused the pylon to lose it's place, and thus become useless.  As a result, the technician first rigged one 1015-24 pylon in place of the 1016-36, and by station 30, added another 1015-24, providing sufficient release mechanisms for all 36 frame sample bottles.  The Knorr's engine department provided outstanding assistance in making the necessary support mounts and modifications to help meet the science objectives.The GO 1015-24 pylons were a source of occasional uncertainty, as it could notalways be determined where a bottle tripped. Sometimes, hydrographic dataindicated that two bottles closed at one stop, and although every effort wasmade to maintain, align and clean the pylons, this problem was not entirelyeliminated. They performed better than anticipated, however, going for more than40 consecutive stations without a mistrip, and allowed the cruise to gather 36samples per cast.Early on in the cruise, the tensiometer for the starboard winch failed.  Thisforced us to use the port winch for the remainder of the cruise.  In addition,station 81 was aborted due to winch problems, when a bearing for the tensionblock failed.On stations 50 through 53, the oxygen sensor with CTD9 was found to be operatingerratically.  It was subsequently replaced. CTD9 had been provided with a newdesign of pressure compensation for the mineral-oil reservoir behind the sensor.This was demonstrated to provide smoother pressure compensation and fewer jumpsin the data as the pressure differential equalized across the oxygen sensormembrane.AQUISITION AND PROCESSING METHODSData from CTD 9 was acquired at 23.8 Hz and with a temperature lag of 150 ms.Data from CTD 12 was acquired at 25.0 Hz and with a temperature lag of 200 ms.The temperature lag was checked by comparing density reversals in theta salinity(TS) plots (Giles and McDonald, 1986).  It was found that the afore mentionedlags showed the least amount of looping or density reversals.Data was acquired by an EG&G Mk-III deck unit providing demodulated data to twopersonal computers running EG&G version 5.2 rev 2 CTD acquisition software(EG&G, Oceansoft acquisition manual, 1990), one providing graphical data toscreen and plotter, and the other a running listing output. Bottom approach wascontrolled by following the pinger direct and bottom return signals on the ship-provided PDR trace.After each station, the CTD data was forwarded to another set of personalcomputers running both EG&G CTD post-processing 3.0 software and custom-builtsoftware from WHOI (Millard and Yang, 1993).  The data was first-differenced, lag corrected, pressure sorted, and pressure-centered into 2 decibar bins for final data quality control and analysis, including fitting to water sample salinity and oxygen results.SUMMARY OF LABORATORY CALIBRATIONS FOR CTDSThe pressure, temperature, and conductivity sensors were calibrated by MarenTracy Plueddemann and Marshall Swartz at the Woods Hole OceanographicInstitution's CTD Calibration Laboratory.PRESSURE CALIBRATIONSMETHOD/CALIBRATION STANDARDSThe pressure transducers of CTD9, CTD12, ICTD1338, and ICTD1344 were calibratedin a temperature controlled bath to WHOI's Ruska Model 2480 Dead Weight Tester(DWT) as described by Millard and Yang (1993) over the range of atmospheric to6,200 dbars.The pre-cruise pressure calibration was performed at three differenttemperatures, 1.78°C, 14.82°C, and 30.10°C. The calibrations were completedNovember 7, 1994. Post-cruise pressure calibrations were performed at only onetemperature point, 1.20°C and were completed April 7, 1995.       ______________________________________________________________                                 BIAS         SLOPE       QUADRATIC        -------------------  ------------  -----------  ------------        CTD 9        pre-cruise   1.78°C  -.495103E+01  .100588E+00   .112622E-10                    14.82°C  -.439017E+01  .100576E+00   .100853E-09                    30.10°C  -.371797E+01  .100592E+00  -.192585E-09        post-cruise  1.20°C  -.421198E+01  .100585E+00   .847090E-10        CTD 12        pre-cruise   1.78°C  -.405781E+02  .107379E+00   .430549E-09                    14.82°C  -.399422E+02  .107390E+00   .370115E-09                    30.10°C  -.392364E+02  .107395E+00   .383934E-09        post-cruise  1.20°C  -.395154E+02  .107384E+00   .385736E-09        ICTD 1338        pre-cruise   1.78°C   .707844E+00  .999402E-01   .131998E-09                    14.82°C   .674421E+00  .999320E-01   .368154E-09                    30.10°C   .177411E+00  .999467E-01   .248022E-09        post-cruise  1.20°C   .152460E+01  .998550E-01   .734740E-09        ICTD 1344        pre-cruise   1.78°C   .293056E+01  .999521E-01  -.263500E-09                    14.82°C   .168364E+01  .999844E-01  -.360033E-09                    30.10°C   .171705E+01  .999784E-01  -.291289E-09        post-cruise  1.20°C   .410510E+01  .999568E-01  -.466373E-09       ______________________________________________________________TEMPERATURE CALIBRATIONSMETHOD/CALIBRATION STANDARDSFor both the pre and post cruise temperature calibrations an Automated SystemsLaboratory (ASL) F18 temperature bridge with a Rosemount 162-CE SPRT were usedas transfer standards. During the calibration, the CTD was fully immersed in awell-stirred constant temperature 700-liter salt water bath. The pre-cruisetemperature calibration was completed November 1, 1994 for all instrumentsbrought on the cruise. The post-cruise temperature calibration was completedMarch 17, 1995 on CTD 9. Due to a failure of CTD 12, a post-cruise calibrationcould not be performed. The CTD worked fine during the cruise, however duringthe post cruise calibration the CTD was unable to synch on the data. Data isreported to WOCE on the ITS-90 scale, but is processed internally on the IPTS-68scale for compatibility with the equations for the Practical Salinity Scale of1978 (PSS-78).________________________________________________________________________________CTD PRIMARY PLATINUM TEMPERATURE                           BIAS           SLOPE        QUADRATIC        -----------    ------------    -----------   ------------        CTD 9        pre-cruise     -.179120E+01    .496261E-03    .385531E-11        post-cruise    -.179285E+01    .496217E-03    .467567E-11        CTD 12        pre-cruise      .621572E+01    .499695E-03    .688332E-12        post-cruise         N/A            N/A            N/A        ICTD 1338        pre-cruise      .198004E-02    .499934E-03   -.483458E-12        post-cruise     .213918E-02    .499918E-03   -.971791E-12        ICTD 1344        pre-cruise     -.452392E-02    .500201E-03   -.330744E-11        post-cruise    -.643159E-02    .500258E-03   -.404936E-11OXYGEN TEMPERATURE                           BIAS          SLOPE         QUADRATIC        -----------    ------------    -----------   ------------        CTD 9        pre-cruise      .717010E-02    .124856E+00   -.381392E-05        post-cruise     .197632E+00    .123681E+00   -.494725E-05        CTD 12        pre-cruise     -.771413E+01    .761267E-03   -.186160E-08        post-cruise         N/A           N/A            N/A        ICTD 1338        pre-cruise          N/A           N/A            N/A        post-cruise    -.201461E+01    .161598E+00   -.127533E-03        ICTD 1344        pre-cruise     -.374508E+01    .153921E+00   -.836036E-04        post-cruise    -.401615E+01    .159201E+00   -.125456E-03PRESSURE TEMPERATURE                                                          S1          S2     T0        -----------    ------------    -----------    --------------------------        CTD 9                                                 pre-cruise      .376241E+02   -.938036E-02    -1.7188E-2   .035381  1.78        post-cruise     .374444E+02   -.920480E-02        CTD 12        pre-cruise      .145943E+03   -.374919E-02     4.1010E-7   .047316  1.78        post-cruise         N/A            N/A        (Note: ICTDs do not have a separately reporting temperature channel).________________________________________________________________________________CONDUCTIVITY CALIBRATIONSMETHOD/CALIBRATION STANDARDSA pre-cruise conductivity calibration was performed on CTD 9 and CTD 12.

The on deck pressure was found using by graphing the calculatedpressure prior to the package entering the water. This number was thensubtracted from the pressure bias term for each station.CONDUCTIVITY CALIBRATIONBASIC FITTING PROCEDUREThe CTD conductivity sensor data was fit to the water sample conductivity asdescribed in Millard and Yang 1993. The stations were fit as a drift of thesensor was noted.  OXYGEN CALIBRATIONSBASIC FITTING PROCEDUREThe CTD oxygen sensor variables were fit to water sample oxygen data todetermine the six parameters of the oxygen algorithm (Millard and Yang, 1993).As with conductivity, the stations were fit as a drift in the sensor was noted.QUALITY CONTROL OF 2DB CTD DATA AND SEA FILESStations 3, 8, 31, and 62 had several pressure bins where there was no CTD data.These bins have been marked as 6's in the *.CTD files. During these stationsthere were a lot of synch errors in the raw data that had to be cleaned up andthis resulted in very few good scans in several pressure bins.For stations 1 and 2, where the oxygen sensors were not working, the CTD valuesin the *.CTD and *.SEA files were changed to -9.000 and the quality word to 5.For CTD9, stations 50-53 the oxygen sensor showed erroneous values. The CTDoxygen values were again changed to -9.000 and the quality word change to 5 toreflect the bad sensor. For stations 46 and 47 it was noted that the sensor mayhave begun failing, thus the quality word for these oxygen CTD values waschanged to 3 to reflect a questionable oxygen value in both the *.CTD and *.SEAfile.In the *.SEA files the down trace CTD oxygen value is used, in some cases therewas no pressure bin in the down trace so the oxygen value was taken from thenearest pressure bin. These values are marked as questionable in the *.SEAfiles.REFERENCES:Giles, Alan B. and Trevor J. McDonald. 1986. Two methods for the reduction of    Salinity Spiking of CTDs.

These bottles have the same outer dimensions asstandard 10 liter Niskin bottles, but use a modified end-cap design to minimizethe contact of the water sample with the end-cap O-rings after closing. The O-rings used in these water sample bottles were vacuum-baked prior to the firststation on the Indian Ocean Expedition. Stainless steel springs covered with anylon powder coat were substituted for the internal elastic tubing standardlyused to close Niskin bottles.CFC samples were drawn from approximately 50% of 4600 water samples collectedduring the expedition. Water samples for CFC analysis were usually the firstsamples drawn from the 10 liter bottles. Care was taken to co-ordinate thesampling of CFCs with other samples to minimize the time between the initialopening of each bottle and the completion of sample drawing. In most cases,dissolved oxygen, total CO2, alkalinity and pH samples were collected withinseveral minutes of the initial opening of each bottle. To minimize contact withair, the CFC samples were drawn directly through the stopcocks of the 10 literbottles into 100 ml precision glass syringes equipped with 2-way metalstopcocks. The syringes were immersed in a holding tank of clean surfaceseawater until analysed.To reduce the possibility of contamination from high levels of CFCs frequentlypresent in the air inside research vessels, the CFC extraction/analysis systemand syringe holding tank were housed in a modified 20' laboratory van on the aftdeck of the ship.For air sampling, a ~100 meter length of 3/8" OD Dekaron tubing was run from theCFC lab van to the bow of the ship. Air was pulled through this line into theCFC van using an Air Cadet pump. The air was compressed in the pump, with thedownstream pressure held at about 1.5 atm using a back-pressure regulator. A teeallowed a flow (~100 cc/min) of the compressed air to be directed to the gassample valves, while the bulk flow of the air (>7 liters per minute) was ventedthrough the back pressure regulator.Concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air samples, seawater and gas standardson the cruise were measured by shipboard electron capture gas chromatography,using techniques similar to those described by Bullister and Weiss (1988). TheCFC system used was built at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and hadbeen used on several Pacific WOCE legs as well as several Indian Ocean WOCElegs. The SIO system was modified from the Bullister and Weiss (1988) design touse a fixed volume, variable pressure gas loop injection system. The sampleloops were either pressurized or evacuated to known pressures in order to varythe amount of gas sample introduced. The sample loop(s) were periodically filledwith CFC-free gas to one atmosphere and analyzed to check for analytical blanks.The typical analysis time for a seawater, air, standard or blank sample wasabout 12 minutes.The CFC analytical system functioned well during this expedition.Concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air, seawater samples and gas standardsare reported relative to the SIO93 calibration scale (Cunnold, et. al., 1994).CFC concentrations in air and standard gas are reported in units of molefraction CFC in dry gas, and are typically in the parts-per-trillion (ppt)range. Dissolved CFC concentrations are given in units of picomoles of CFC perkg seawater (pmol/kg). CFC concentrations in air and seawater samples weredetermined by fitting their chromatographic peak areas to multi-pointcalibration curves, generated by pressurizing sample loops and injecting knownvolumes of gas from a CFC working standard (PMEL cylinder 38415) into theanalytical instrument. The concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in this workingstandard were calibrated versus a primary CFC standard (36743) (Bullister, 1984)before the cruise and a secondary standard (32386) before and after the cruise.Full range calibration curves were run several times (approx. every 5 daysduring the cruise). Single injections of a fixed volume of standard gas at oneatmosphere were run much more frequently (at intervals of 1 to 2 hours) tomonitor short term changes in detector sensitivity.As expected, low (~0.015 pmol/kg) but non-zero CFC concentrations were measuredin deep and bottom samples along the northern ends (~32S) of I8S and I9S. Deepand bottom CFC concentrations increased significantly southward along thesections. It is likely that most of the deep CFC signals observed on I8S andI9S, which are strongly correlated with elevated dissolved oxygen and coldtemperatures, are due to deep ventilation processes in this high latituderegion, and not simply blanks due of the sampling and analytical procedures. Themeasured levels of CFC in deep water samples on the northern ends I8S and I9Ssections are considerable higher than those found on WOCE sections in the lowlatitude Indian Ocean. For example, typical measured deep water CFC measurementsalong WOCE section I2 (at about 8S) were ~0.003 pmol/kg for CFC-11 and <0.001for CFC-12. Since no "zero" CFC water was present anywhere along I8S or I9S, andlater cruises (e.g. I2) showed low CFC blanks for the sampling procedures, nocorrections for 'sampling blanks' have been applied to the reported CFC signalsfor I8S and I9S. A few samples (~86 of a total of ~2300) had clearly anomalousCFC-11 and/or CFC-12 concentrations relative to adjacent samples. These appearedto occur more or less randomly, and were not clearly associated with otherfeatures in the water column (e.g. elevated oxygen concentrations, salinity ortemperature features, etc.). This suggests that the high values were due toisolated low-level CFC contamination events. These samples are included in thisreport and are flagged as either 3 (questionable) or 4 (bad) measurements. Atotal of 32 analyses of CFC-11 were assigned a flag of 3 and 25 analyses of CFC-12 were assigned a flag of 3. A total of 17 analyses of CFC-11 were assigned aflag of 4 and 24 CFC-12 samples assigned a flag of 4.On this expedition, we estimate precisions (1 standard deviation) of about 1% or0.005 pmol/kg (whichever is greater) for dissolved CFC-11 and 1% or 0.005pmol/kg (whichever is greater) for dissolved CFC-12 measurements (see listing ofreplicate samples given at the end of this report).In addition to the file of mean CFC concentrations, tables of the following areincluded in this report:  Table 1a.

The measurements were conducted as part ofthe World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  The expedition began inFremantle, Australia, on December 1, 1994, and ended in Mombasa, Kenya, on January 22, 1996.  During the nine cruises, 12 WOCE sections were occupied.Total carbon dioxide was extracted from water samples and measured using single-operator multiparameter metabolic analyzers (SOMMAs) coupled to coulometers.The overall precision and accuracy of the analyses was ±1.20 µmol/kg.  Thesecond carbonate system parameter, TALK, was determined by potentiometrictitration.  The precision of the measurements determined from 962 analyses ofcertified reference material was ±4.2 µmol/kg (REFERENCE).  This work wassupported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Departmentof Energy, and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.The R/V Knorr Indian Ocean data set is available as a numeric data package (NDP)from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC).  The NDP consistsof 18 oceanographic data files, two FORTRAN 77 data retrieval routine files, areadme file, and this printed documentation, which describes the contents andformat of all files as well as the procedures and methods used to obtain thedata.

BACKGROUND INFORMATIONThe World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP) was amajor component of the World Climate Research Program.  The primary WOCE goalwas to understand the general circulation of the global ocean well enough to beable to model its present state and predict its evolution in relation to long-term changes in the atmosphere.  The impetus for the carbon system measurementsarose from concern over the rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide(CO2).  Increasing atmospheric CO2 may intensify the earth's natural greenhouseeffect and alter the global climate.The carbon measurements, which were carried out on the U.S. WOCE Indian Oceancruises, were supported as a core component of the Joint Global Ocean FluxStudy (JGOFS).  This coordinated effort received support in the United Statesfrom the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Goals were toestimate the meridional transport of inorganic carbon in a manner analogous tothe estimates of oceanic heat transport (Bryden and Hall 1980; Brewer, Goyet,and Drysen 1989; Holfort et al. 1998; Roemmich and Wunsch 1985) and to build adatabase suitable for carbon-cycle modeling and the estimation of anthropogenicCO2 in the oceans.  The global data set includes approximately 23,000 stations.Wallace (2001) recently reviewed the goals, conduct, and initial findings ofthe survey.This report discusses the CO2 science team effort to sample the entire IndianOcean for inorganic carbon (Fig.1).  The total CO2 (TCO2) and total alkalinity(TALK) were measured in the water column and the fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) in thesurface waters [see Sabine and Key (1998) for a description of the fCO2 methodsand data].  The TCO2 analytical systems were furnished and set up by BrookhavenNational Laboratory under the supervision of D.W.R. Wallace and K.M.Johnson, and the alkalinity titrators were furnished and set up by theUniversity of Miami under the supervision of F.J. Millero.  During the survey,certified reference material (CRM) was used to ensure measurement accuracy.  Allshipboard measurements followed standard operating procedures (DOE 1994).  Thisreport focuses on TCO2 and TALK measurements.  Because the team shared equipmentthroughout all nine cruises and so much material, including quality assessmentsof the data, has already appeared in the refereed literature, it will belimited to a brief summary.  Published documentation appears in appendices.2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPEDITION2.1.  R/V Knorr: Technical Details and HistoryThe R/V Knorr, built in 1969 by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City,Michigan, is owned by the U.S. Navy.  It was turned over to the Woods HoleOceanographic Institution in 1971 for operation under a charter agreement withthe Office of Naval Research.  It was named for E.R. Knorr, a hydrographicengineer and cartographer who in 1860 held the title of Senior Civilian andChief Engineer Cartographer of the U.S. Navy Office.  Its original length andbeam were 245 and 46 ft, respectively.  Beginning on February 6, 1989, itunderwent a major midlife retrofit or "jumbo-izing" at the McDermott Shipyardin Amelia, Louisiana.  A midsection was added to the ship to stretch its lengthby 34 ft, to 279 ft, and fore and aft azimuthing propulsion systems were addedto make it one of the most maneuverable and stable ships in the oceanographicfleet. By the time it was returned to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutionin late 1991, the retrofit had taken 32 months.  The P6 Section was the vessel'sfirst scientific cruise after the retrofitting.  The R/V Knorr was designed fora wide range of oceanographic operations and possesses antiroll tanks and astrengthened bow for duty in icy waters.  Like its sister ship, the R/VMelville, it is used for ocean research and routinely carries scientists frommany different countries.  Table 1 provides a list of technical characteristicsof the R/V Knorr, while Table 2 provides individual cruise information,parameters measured, and responsible personnel with their institutionalaffiliations.2.2.

Brief Cruise SummaryUnlike other CO2 survey cruises where a single institution was responsible forall phases of the work, these cruises were a group effort in which themeasurement groups used the same ship and  instrumentation for a 14-monthperiod.  BNL supplied two single-operator multiparameter metabolic analyzers(SOMMA) systems [S/N 004(I) and 006(II)] that were certified at BNL.  A completeback-up system (S/N 023) was supplied by WHOI.  The alkalinity titrators weresupplied by RSMAS.  Preparation began with a 4-day workshop held in September1994 at RSMAS under the direction of and in the laboratory of F.J. Millero.Cruise participants and group leaders from BNL, LDEO, SIO, RSMAS, PU, WHOI, andUH were instructed in the use of the alkalinity titrators by F.J. Millero andD. Campbell and in the use of the SOMMA-coulometer systems by K.M. Johnson andR.W. Wilke.  The day after Thanksgiving the BNL and RSMAS TCO2 groups left forAustralia.  Setup of the alkalinity and coulometric titration systems began onNovember 28, 1994.  The I8SI9S cruise began on December 1, 1994.The first of the nine cruises on the R/V Knorr was the longest continuous cruiseduring the survey.  It occupied a series of CTD stations along two north-southtracks essentially proceeding from Australia to the ice edge (I8S) along 90°Eand then back again to Australia (I9S) at approximately 110°E.  Station spacing ranged from 5 to 40 nautical miles (nm).  Testing and selection of the best of the available titration systems and components was completed during I8S.  The alkalinity and especially the coulometric titration systems benefited from This "shake-out" period.  Components damaged during transit were identified andrepaired or replaced.  By the beginning of the I9S, operations were more or lessroutine.  Except for one approximately 12-h period when high winds of ~60 knots(kn) made sampling impossible, work proceeded pretty much on schedule during the50-day cruise.  During the cruise the ability of a team of four marine mammaland bird observers onboard from PMEL, under the direction of C. Tynan, to remainin the cold weather and identify whales that were little more than blips on thehorizon amazed all participants of the expedition.  Both Christmas and New Yearholidays were celebrated aboard the ship.  The fine Christmas dinner washighlighted by the appearance of three humpback whales, who put on a spectaculardisplay, jumping and passing under and about the ship.  The ship docked inFremantle, to the relief of the CO2 team members, on January 19, 1995, after 147stations were occupied.  Measurement crews were exchanged, and the new teambrought along some badly needed spare parts and components.The ship departed Fremantle for I9N on January 24 with A. Gordon as ChiefScientist and a CO2 measurement group from PU.  This section was basically anorthward continuation of I8S.  The weather was perfect during all 43 days ofthe cruise.  The participants celebrated the equator crossing on February 14.This cruise ended on March 5 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with 131 stations logged.During the stopover, the carrier gas supply for the coulometric titrators wasshifted from bottled high purity nitrogen to a calibration gas generator (PeakScientific), which supplied CO2-free carrier gas for the remaining of thecruises.I8NI5E began in Colombo on March 10 with L. Talley as chief scientist and a CO2measurement group from UH on board.  No problems were noted for the samplingprogram, and the weather remained excellent for most of this leg.  The shiptrack proceeded southward from Sri Lanka along 88°E to 24°S, then angledsoutheastward to the junction of the Ninety-East Ridge and Broken Ridge.  Next,the ship followed a 1987 section along approximately 32°S.  This zonal sectionincluded the Central Indian Basin, and crossed the northward flow of deep waterjust west of Australia.  Due to the good weather, some extra sampling wascarried out, and by the time the ship docked in Fremantle on April 15, 166stations had been occupied.  On station 296, the rosette accidentally hit bottomat 3630 m, but the cast was successfully completed.  A postcruise inspectionshowed no apparent damage to the equipment.  This cruise included sampling forparticulate organic carbon (POC) in the surface waters near the equator.  POCsamples were also taken at 65 stations for 13C/12C analyses.  Between April 15and 23, measurement crews were exchanged and spare parts inventories wereupdated.On April 23, the R/V Knorr departed Fremantle for section I3 with W. Nowlin aschief scientist and a CO2 measurement group from RSMAS.  The ship had to detouralmost immediately back to Fremantle for a medical emergency.  The injuredanalyst was able to rejoin the ship in Port Louis, Mauritius.  In addition tothe CTD work, this cruise included the deployment of current meters, drifters,and autonomous Lagrangian circulation explorer (ALACE) floats.  The cruise trackran along 20°S from Australia to Mauritius to Madagascar, crossing the WestAustralian Basin, Ninety-East Ridge, Central Indian Basin, and Central IndianRidge before veering southward to 22  S around Rodrigues Island.  After this, itproceeded to the east coast of Mauritius, where a 2-day port stop was made inPort Louis.  Returning to sea, the ship continued sampling westward along 20°Sfrom the continental shelf to Madagascar.  Weather was characterized bysoutheasterly winds of 10-20 kn, mostly sunny skies, occasional rain squalls,and 4-6 ft swells with slightly higher winds and seas in mid-May.  The Knorrreturned to Port Louis, Mauritius, on June 5 with 120 stations logged.The next cruise, I4I5W, began on June 11 with J. Toole as chief scientist and aCO2 measurement group from BNL on board.  This leg focused on major circulationfeatures of the southwest region of the Indian Ocean, including the region wherethe Agulhas Current originates and where dense waters filtering through fractures in the Southwest Indian Ridge form a northward deep boundary currenteast of Madagascar.  The cruise track formed a closed box to aid in deducing theabsolute circulation.  A stop was made in Durban, South Africa, on June 21 topick up a replacement drum of CTD wires.  Attempts were also made to repair theship's bow thruster, which had failed very early in the leg; although the repairwas not successful, the lack of a bow thruster had no effect on the scientificwork.  The R/V Knorr departed Durban on June 22 and began I5W including reoccupation of stations where data had been taken in 1987.  Bad weather wasexperienced on June 30 when wind gusts of 40-50 kn and high seas slowed winchoperations.  As the ship moved across the Madagascar Basin toward port, stationspacing was decreased to 20 nm.  When the ship arrived in port on July 11, 136stations had been occupied 20 more than planned.After four days in port, the R/V Knorr departed on I7N with D. Olson as chiefscientist and a CO2 measurement group from UH.  The director of the U.S. WOCEoffice, Piers Chapman, was aboard and served as a salt analyst during thesection.  I7N was designed to define the water mass properties and transportsacross the Mascarene Basin and to measure water mass properties and baroclinicstructure on a short section across the Amirante Passage, located between theMascarene and Somali Basins.  It included a cross-equatorial section and areoccupation of stations previously sampled to confirm water mass flows.  Thiswork included sampling along 65°E in the central Arabian Basin.  The concluding phase of the cruise was a deep line of stations up the center of the Gulf of Oman.  The last station of this phase was in the Strait of Hormuz, and it identified inflows of Arabian (Persian) Gulf water into the Arabian Basin.  The cruise terminated on August 24 in Muscat, Oman, with 156 stations occupied.After a 5-day layover, the R/V Knorr departed Muscat on I1 with J. Morrison aschief scientist and a CO2 measurement group from WHOI.  I1 was the northernmostIndian Ocean section.  It enclosed the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, which areimportant sources of salt and fresh water, respectively.  The Knorr proceededfrom Muscat to the southern end of the Red Sea and then to the coast of Somali,where the zonal section started at a nominal latitude of 8°N.  The sectioncrossed the Arabian Sea, in part to study the carbon transport in and out of theArabian Sea, and ended on the continental shelf of India.  After a brief portstop in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on September 28-30, the leg continued from the SriLankan shelf across the Bay of Bengal to the Myanmar continental shelf.  CTDproblems caused considerable difficulty for the scientific party and resulted ina somewhat noisy hydrographic data set compared to data obtained from the othersections.  After the last station on the Myanmar shelf, the Knorr deadheaded toSingapore, arriving on October 16 with 158 stations logged.  I1 was not only thenorthernmost section, it was clearly the most adventurous.  ALACE float deployments had to be canceled in the territorial waters of India because theIndian observer on board refused to allow them, and then the threat of piratescaused the cancellation of a planned section across the Gulf of Aden.  In thevicinity of Colombo, the ship had to be escorted by four Sri Lankan gunboats,and planned stops at stations over the Trincomalee Canyon could not be takenbecause of the threat of attack by the Tamil Tigers.  Nevertheless, the Knorrwas able to coordinate scientific activities and physical oceanographicmeasurements with the nearby R/V Meteor (F. Schott, chief scientist) in an areaof German current meter moorings near Socotra.  Sampling during I1 enabledcomparison of bottle and TCO2 data with earlier JGOFS results and Meteor Pegasusand Knorr lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler (LADCP) horizontal velocities.  From Singapore, the Knorr proceeded to Dampier, Australia, where itwas placed in dry dock from October 19 until November 5.With the R/V Knorr back in the water, the I10 CO2 measurement group from PUarrived.  This group was required to do some additional work not normally part of the crew exchange routine.  During the dry dock period, the CO2 instrumentation had been depowered, and the measurement group had to repower and check the instrumentation.  Some minor repairs were required for the coulometrictitrators, including the replacement of one or two solenoid valves (the onlyvalves replaced during the cruises).  In addition, the sample pipettes andcoolant lines were dismounted and cleaned of algal growth.The R/V Knorr departed Dampier, Australia, on November 11 with N. Bray as chiefscientist.  WOCE Section I10 was set to run from Shark Bay, Western Australia,to the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) 120 nm south of Sunda Strait.However, constraints imposed by the Indonesian government caused the endpoint tobe moved from the Sunda Strait to near central Java.  The Knorr was not grantedpermission to enter the EEZ of Indonesia, and concluding stations had to betaken along the boundary of the EEZ.  These restrictions prevented fullresolution of the South Java current.  Throughout the Indian Ocean survey,bottle casts were normally made to within 5-20 m of the bottom; however, on I10four stations over the Java Trench this could not be done.  Instead, the castswere made to the maximum CTD depth of 6000 m.  The quality of the bottle datawas considered to be excellent throughout with very few mis-trips.  ALACE floatswere also released during this cruise.  A festive Thanksgiving was celebratedaboard the ship, and after the last station (1075), the Knorr steamed toSingapore, arriving on November 28, with 61 stations logged.The R/V Knorr departed Singapore on December 2 for the last Indian Ocean WOCEsection, I2, with G. Johnson as chief scientist and the UH CO2 measurement groupaboard.  Again, clearance for work in the Indonesian EEZ was not available, andafter a 3-day steam, work commenced with a reoccupation of the final station ofthe I10 Section (station 1075).  The Knorr skirted the Indonesian EEZ and movedwestward, crossing the Ninety-East Ridge and the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge.  Theship continued at approximately 8°S until it made a brief port call in DiegoGarcia from December 28-30.  At this point, the chief scientist departed theship and was replaced by Bruce Warren, accompanied by two Kenyan observers.  TheKnorr returned to the 8°S line, passing the crest of the Central Indian Ridgeand then the Mascarene Plateau before it turned southwestward and crossed theAmirante Passage on the way to the northern tip of Madagascar.  Rounding thetip, the ship headed northwest toward Africa, making a dogleg to avoid theTanzanian EEZ.  After completing the final Indian Ocean Survey station 1244, itproceeded to Mombasa, arriving on January 22, 1996, with 168 stations logged.For inorganic carbon, the principal analytical problems for the cruise centeredon the breakage of glass components in the alkalinity titrators; resupply;accumulation of bubbles in the acid lines of the alkalinity titrators; damagedcoulometric cathode electrodes; algal growth in the sample lines, baths,pipettes, and alkalinity cells; wide swings in laboratory temperature (19-33 C),and the failure of the TCO2 glassware drying oven.  Fortunately, glasswaredrying oven was repaired.  Temperature swings (21-29 C) were also noted for thesalinometer and nutrient laboratories.  The most vexing problem for theinorganic carbon analysts was the failure of the refrigerated baths used by boththe alkalinity and coulometric titration systems.  The baths had to beconstantly jury-rigged so that one bath did the work of two, repaired by ship'stechnicians when possible, or replaced when possible.  The two groups usedalmost 12 different baths, and by the time the work ended, not one could beconsidered in reliable condition.  Some were never repaired, while others wererepaired and used for the North Atlantic survey in 1997.3.  DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES AND METHODS3.1.  Hydrographic MeasurementsDuring the survey, responsibility for hydrographic and bottle data was dividedbetween ODF and WHOI.  Each of these groups uses or may use differentprocedures.  Hence, the hydrographic measurements are described in separatesections.  Because the greater number of the cruises were made under theauspices of SIO/ODF, the bulk of the methods description is provided in Sect.3.1.1.  Information specific to WHOI is given in Sect. 3.1.2; in this sectionhowever, the discussion is limited to significant differences between theSIO/ODF and WHOI operations or methods.  Unless otherwise stated in Sect. 3.1.2,material presented in Sect. 3.1.1 applies to all cruises.  Sect. 3.1.3 containsa brief description of the underway measurements common to all cruises.3.1.1  SIO/ODF Methods and InstrumentationHydrographic measurements consisted of salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient(nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate) samples collected from Niskinbottles filled during CTD/rosette casts, and temperature, pressure, salinity,and dissolved oxygen from the CTD.  At 5- to 40-nm intervals, depending on thetopography, hydrographic casts were made to within 5 20 m of the bottom with a36-bottle Rosette frame belonging to ODF.  This unit consisted of a 36-bottleframe, thirty six 10-L bottles, and a 1016 General Oceanics (GO) 36-place pylon.The GO pylon was used in conjunction with an ODF-built deck unit and powersupply.  The underwater components comprising the CTD included an ODF-modifiedNeil Brown Instrument Systems (NBIS) Mark III CTD with conductivity, pressure,oxygen, and temperature sensors.  The underwater package also consisted of aSeaTech transmissometer, an LADCP, a Sensormedics dissolved oxygen sensor, aFalmouth Scientific Instruments (FSI) secondary PRT sensor, a Benthos altimeter,and a Benthos pinger.  The CTD was mounted horizontally along the bottom of theframe, while the LADCP was vertically mounted inside the bottle rings.  Thesystem was suspended from and powered by a three- conductor 0.322-in.electromechanical cable.  The Rosette was deployed from the starboard side usingeither the port side Markey CTD or the starboard side Almon Johnson winch.Standard CTD practices (i.e., soaking the conductivity and O2 sensors indistilled water between casts and protecting the sensors against sunlight andwind by storing the rosette in the hanger between casts) were observedthroughout the cruises.  Regular CTD maintenance included the replacement of O-rings when needed, bottle inspections, and a regular cleaning of thetransmissometer windows.  At the beginning of each station the time, position,and bottom depth were logged.  The CTD sensors were powered and control wastransferred to the CTD acquisition and control system in the ship's laboratory.The CTD was lowered to within 10 m of the bottom if bottom returns wereadequate.  Continuous profiles of horizontal velocity from the sea surface tothe bottom were made for most CTD/rosette casts using the LADCP.The CTD's control and acquisition system displayed real-time data [pressure,depth, tem- perature, salinity (conductivity), oxygen, and density] on the videodisplay of a SunSPARC LX computer.  A video recorder was provided for real-timeanalog backup.  The Sun computer system included a color display, a keyboard, atrackball, a 2.5-GB disk, 18 RS-232 ports, and an 8-mm cartridge tape.  Twoadditional Sun systems were networked for display, backup, and processing.  TwoHP 1200 C color ink-jet printers provided hard copy.  The ODF data acquisitionsoftware not only acquired the CTD data but also processed it so that the real-time data included preliminary sensor corrections and calibration models forpressure, temperature, and conductivity.  The sampling depths were selectedusing down-cast data.  Bottles were tripped on the up-cast.  Bottles on therosette were identified with a serial number and the pylon tripping sequence, 1-36, where the first (deepest) bottle tripped was no. 1.  For shallow-depthstations, fewer than 36 bottles were closed.After the CTD was on deck, the acquisition system, the CTD, the pylon, and videorecording were turned off and the sensor protective measures were completedbefore sampling began.  If a full suite of samples was drawn, the sampling orderwas CFCs, 3He, O2, TCO2, TALK, 14C, 3H, nutrients, and salinity.  Only salinity,O2, and nutrients were measured at every station.  A deck log was kept todocument the sampling sequence and to note anomalies (e.g., status of bottlevalves, leaks, etc.).  One member of the sampling crew was designated the"sample cop," and it was his or her responsibility to maintain this log and toensure that the sampling order was followed.  Oxygen sampling includedmeasurement of the temperature, which proved useful for determining leaking ormis-tripped bottles.  Following the cruises, WHP quality flags were assignedaccording to the WOCE Operations Manual (Joyce and Corry 1994) to each measuredquantity.The principal ODF CTD (no. 1) was calibrated for pressure and temperature at theODF Calibration Facility (La Jolla, Calif.) in December 1994 prior to the fiveconsecutive WOCE Indian Ocean sections beginning with I9N and ending with I7N.The CTD was also calibrated postcruise in September 1995 prior to the I10cruise.  Pre- and postcruise laboratory calibrations were used to generatetables of corrections, which were applied by the CTD data.  At sea, bottlesalinity and oxygen data were to calibrate or check the CTD sensors.  Additionaldetails concerning calibration and the CTD data processing can be obtained fromthe chief scientists' cruise reports at the WHPO web site: http://whpo.uscd.edu/.Bottle salinity samples were collected in 200-mL Kimax high alumina borosilicatebottles, sealed with custom-made plastic insert thimbles and Nalgene screw caps.Salinity was determined after equilibration in a temperature-controlled laboratory, usually within 8-20 h of collection.  Salinity was measured with twoODF-modified Guildline Autosal Model 8400A salinometers, normally at 21 or 24°C, depending on the prevailing temperature of the salinometer laboratory.  The salinometers included interfaces for computer-aided measurements (e.g.,acquiring the measurements, checking for consistency, logging results, andprompting the analyst).  The salinometers were standardized with InternationalAssociation for the Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO) Standard Seawater(SSW) Batches P-124, P-126, or P-128 using at least one fresh vial per cast(usually 36 samples).  The accuracy of the determination was normally 0.002relative to the SSW batch used.  PSS-78 was then calculated for each sample(UNESCO 1981).  On some stations (e.g., on Section I5EI8N), bottle salinityexhibited small offsets (0.002 0.004) compared to the corresponding CTD resultsand bottle salinity from nearby stations, and corrections of this magnitude needto be applied to the bottle salinity.  Errors of this magnitude have nopractical effect on the calculated TCO2 or TALK values.  Hence, bottle salinityis sufficiently accurate to express inorganic carbon results in µmol/kg.Bottle oxygen was determined by rinsing 125-mL iodine flasks twice and thenfilling to overflowing (3x-bottle volume) with a draw tube.  Sample temperaturewas measured immediately with a thermometer imbedded in the draw tube.  TheWinkler reagents were added; and the flask was stoppered, shaken, and thenshaken again 20 min later to ensure that the dissolved O2 was completely fixed.Oxygen was determined within 4 h of collection using a whole-bottle modifiedWinkler titration following the technique of Carpenter (1965) and incorporatingthe modifications of Culberson et al. (1991) on an SIO/ODF-designed automatedoxygen titrator.  A Dosimat 665 burette driver fitted with a 1.0-mL burette wasused to dispense thiosulfate solution (50 g/L).  Standards prepared frompreweighed potassium iodate (0.012N) were run each time the automated titratorwas used, and reagent blanks were determined by analyzing distilled water.  Thefinal oxygen results were converted to µmol/kg using the in situ temperature.Bottle volumes were precalibrated at SIO.  Laboratory temperature stabilityduring the sections was considered poor, varying from 22 to 28°C over short time periods; and therefore, portable fans were used by ODF analysts to maintaintemperature.Phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, and silicate samples were collected in 45-mL high-density polypropylene, narrow-mouth, screw-capped centrifuge tubes which werecleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl) and then rinsed three times with samplebefore filling.  The samples were analyzed on an ODF-modified four-channelTechnicon AutoAnalyzer II, usually within 1 h of the cast, in a temperature-controlled laboratory.  If the samples were stored for longer than 1 h prior toanalysis, they were stored at 2 6°C (for no more than 4 h).  The AutoAnalyzerincorporates the method of Armstrong, Stearns, and Strickland (1967) forsilicate, this same method as modified for nitrate and nitrite, and the methodof Bernhardt and Wilhelms (1967) for phosphate.  The last method is described byGordon and coworkers (Atlas et al. 1971; Hager et al. 1972; and Gordon et al.1992).  Standards were analyzed at the beginning and end of each group of sampleanalyses, with a set of secondary intermediate concentrations prepared bydiluting preweighed primary standards.  Replicates were also drawn at eachstation for measurement of short-term precision.  For reagent blanks, deionizedwater (DIW) from a Barnstead Nanopure deionizer fed from the ship's potablewater supply was analyzed.  An aliquot of deep seawater was run with each set of samples as a substandard.  The primary standard for silicate was Na2SiF6; andfor nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate the standards were KNO3, NaNO2, and KH2PO4,respectively.  Chemical purity ranged from 99.97% (NaNO2) to 99.999% (KNO3).Most hydrographic data sets met or exceeded the WHP requirements.  Someexceptions for silicate were noted when differences between overlapping stationson I3 (Station 548) and I4I5W (Stations 705 and 574) approached 3%; thesesilicate data (Stations 702-707) were corrected by adding 3% to the originalresults.  Instrument problems also caused difficulties for the nitrite andsilicate analyses on many of the I2 cruise stations.  Silicate problems werenoted at some 30% of these stations, with errors typically being on the order of2 4%.  This required considerable post- cruise evaluation and workup before thedesired between-station precision for deep water values of 1% was attained.However, users of the I2 silicate data are urged to use caution or to contactthe analysts for assistance.  Because of the difficulties with the nutrientanalyses on the I2 cruise, the post-cruise I2 precision is given in Table 7 as a"worst case" for comparison with the WHP standards shown in Table 6.  Short-termprecision is the absolute mean difference between replicates analyzed within asample run; the standard deviation of the differences is also shown. The authorsknow of no remaining CTD problems, that would affect the quality of the carbonate system data.TABLE 6: Required WHP accuracy for deep water analyses         ___________________________________________          Parameter  Required accuracy          ---------  ------------------------------          Salinity   0.002 relative to SSW analysed          Oxygen     1% (2 µmol/kg)          Nitrate    1% (0.3 0.4 µmol/L)          Phosphate  1% (0.02 0.03 µmol/L)          Silicate   1% (1 5 µmol/L)         ___________________________________________TABLE 7: The short-term precision of the nutrient analyses for Indian Ocean         Section I2         ______________________________________          Parameter     Difference  ± St. Dev.                         (µmol/L)          ------------  ----------  ----------          Nitrate         0.123       0.093          Phosphate       0.015       0.009          Silicic Acid    0.440       0.260         ______________________________________3.1.2  WHOI Methods and InstrumentationsUnless otherwise stated procedures are as described in Sect. 3.1.1, above.  Forthe hydrographic work on I8SI9S, I1, and I2, the R/V Knorr was outfitted withequipment belonging to both WHOI and SIO/ODF.  For the I8SI9S section a NBIS CTDwas used.  For I1, four CTDs were available.  The primary sensors were two newFSI CTDs belonging to WHOI with a Sensormedics oxygen sensors, a titaniumpressure transducer, and a temperature monitor.  The secondary sensors were twoNBIS Mark-III CTDs (WHOI Nos. 9 and 12) also with a Sensormedics oxygen sensor,a titanium pressure transducer, and a temperature monitor. The MKIII CTDsexperienced failures early during I1 (Stations 858 and 864), and the bulk of thehydrography was carried out using the FSI (Nos. 1338 and 1344) CTDs.  Usually,the frame was set up with the two CTDs - one configured to send data up the wireand one configured to record data internally.  Electrical modifications had tobe made to the CTDs and the deck controllers before CTD data dropouts wereeliminated and the confirmation of bottle closure from the pylon was restored.For the CTDs, a FSI DT-1050 deck unit was initially used to demodulate the data,but this unit was replaced for most of the cruise with an EG&G MK-III deck unit.These units fed serial data to two personal computers (PCs) running EG&G CTDacquisition software, with one displaying graphical output and the other arunning data listing.  After each station, the CTD data were forwarded toanother set of PCs running EG&G postprocessing and software modified by WHOI(Millard and Yang 1993) in which the data were centered into 2 dbar bins fordata quality control, which included fitting to bottle salinity and oxygenresults.The CTDs were calibrated before and after the cruise for temperature andpressure at WHOI by M. Swartz and M. Plueddemann.  Both calibrations wereconsistent, but the data set for I1 was considered to be only of fair qualitybecause noise levels in the data set are somewhat larger than typical for otherCTDs.  For example, this data set has a salt noise level of 0.002 which is 2times larger than the norm.  Residuals between the bottle and profile data rangefrom 0.001 to 0.004.  For a detailed discussion of the CTD calibration andproblems experienced at sea during I1, consult the chief scientist's cruisereport on the WHPO web site.For I2, WHOI CTD No. 9, a WHOI-modified NBIS MK-IIIb, was used.  The CTDincorporated a Sensormedics oxygen sensor, titanium pressure transducer, andtemperature sensor, which were calibrated in November 1995 immediately beforethe cruise.  On most stations, one of the FSI CTDs was used in the memory modeand downloaded after station sampling to provide independent or backup CTDtraces.  An FSI Ocean Temperature Module was also attached to the MK-III andCTDs.  The Mark-III CTD data were acquired using an NBIS Mark-III deckunit/display that provided demodulated data to two PCs, as described for theSection I1 cruise.  A PC was also devoted to recovering the data from the FSICTDs.  Post-cruise calibration, including dunk tests of the CTDs, was completedin April and May of 1996 in the WHOI calibration laboratory.  The procedure ofMillard and Yang (1993) was used to correct the pressure temperature sensorcalibration post-cruise to eliminate down/up pressure historesis.  Multipleregression fits of the CTD data to the bottle data were used to calibrate theoxygen and conductivity sensors.  See the chief scientist's report on the WHPOweb site for further details.Bottle salinity samples were collected in 200-mL glass bottles with removablepolyethylene inserts and caps.  Then they were removed to a temperature-controlled van at 23 C and analyzed on a Guildline Autosal Model 8400Bsalinometer (WHOI No. 11).  The salinometer was standardized once a day usingIAPSO SSW (128, dated July 18, 1995).  The accuracy was ~0.002.  A completedescription of the WHOI measurement techniques is given by Knapp, Stalcup, andStanley (1990).Bottle oxygen was determined according to procedures given by Knapp, Stalcup,and Stanley (1990).  WHOI used a modified Winkler technique similar to thatdescribed by Strickland and Parsons (1972).  The oxygen reagents and bi-iodatestandard were prepared at WHOI in August 1994.  There was no evidence that thereagents or standard deteriorated during the 17 months they were aboard theKnorr.  Standardization of the thiosulphate titrant was made daily.  Theaccuracy of the method was 0.5%, or approximately 1.0 µmol/kg.The nutrients were analyzed as described in Sect. 3.1.1 (see also Gordon et al.1994).3.1.3.  Underway MeasurementsNavigational data (heading, speed, time, date, and position) were acquired fromthe ship's Magnavox MX global positioning system (GPS) receiver via RS-232 andlogged automatically at 1-min intervals on a SunSPARC station.  Underwaybathymetry was logged manually at 5-min intervals from the hull-mounted 12-kHzecho sounder and a Raytheon recorder corrected according to methods described byCarter (1980).  These data were merged with the navigation data to provide atime-series of underway position, course, speed, and bathymetry data that wereused for all station positions, depths, and vertical sections.  The ImprovedMETeorology (IMET) sensors logged meteorological data which  included airtemperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity, sea surface temperature,and wind speed and direction at 1-min intervals.  Underway shipboardmeasurements were made throughout the work to document the horizontal velocitystructure along the cruise tracks using a 150-kHz hull-mounted acoustic Dopplercurrent profiler (ADCP) manufactured by RD Instruments.  The ADCP was mounted ata depth of 5 m below the sea surface.  Underway chemical measurements inwater and air included salinity, pCO2 (PU and SIO), pN2O (SIO), and CH4 (SIO).Two different systems were used for pCO2; the PU group used a rotating diskequilibrator and infrared detector, while the Scripps group used a shower typeequilibrator and gas chromatograph for the detection of CO2.  The pCO2measurements, including a comparison of the shower and disk equilibratorresults, were described by Sabine and Key (1998).A thermosalinograph (manufactured at FSI) was mounted on the bow approximately3 m below the surface for underway salinity, which was calibrated againstsurface CTD and bottle salinity values after the cruise (Sabine and Key 1998).The CFC groups periodically analyzed air for CFCs using sampling lines from thebow and stern of the ship.3.2.  Total Carbon Dioxide MeasurementsTCO2 was determined on 18,963 samples using two automated single-operatormultiparameter metabolic analyzers (SOMMA) with coulometric detection of the CO2extracted from acidified samples.  A description of the SOMMA-coulometry systemand its calibration can be found in Johnson et al. 1987; Johnson and Wallace1992; and Johnson et al. 1993.  A schematic diagram of the SOMMA analyticalsequence and a complete description of the sampling and analytical methods usedfor discrete TCO2 on the Indian Ocean WOCE sections appear in Appendix B(Johnson et al. 1998).  Further details concerning the coulometric titration canbe found in Huffman (1977) and Johnson, King, and Sieburth (1985).  Themeasurements for the Indian Ocean Survey were made on two systems provided byBNL (S/Ns 004 and 006) and a backup by WHOI (S/N 023).TCO2 samples were collected from approximately every other station [~ 60 nmintervals, 50% of the stations (Fig. 2)] in 300-mL glass biological oxygendemand (BOD) bottles.  They were immediately poisoned with 200 µL of a 50%saturated solution of HgCl2, thermally equilibrated at 20°C for at least 1 h,and analyzed within 24 h of collection (DOE Handbook of Methods 1994).  Certified reference material (CRM) samples were routinely analyzed, usually at the beginning and end of the coulometer cell lifetime, according to DOE (1994).  As an additional check of internal consistency, duplicate samples were usuallycollected on each cast at the surface and from the bottom waters.  Theseduplicates were analyzed on the same system within the run of cast samples fromwhich they originated, but the analyses were separated in time usually by ~3 h.Periodically, replicate samples were also drawn for shipboard analysis at seausing coulometry and for later analysis on shore at SIO by manometry.  Thelatter samples, typically designated as the "Keeling samples," consisted of two500-mL replicate samples collected at two depths (four samples total perstation).  These were analyzed only if both replicates survived the storage andthe return journey to SIO.Seawater introduced from an automated "to-deliver" (TD) pipette into a strippingchamber was acidified, and the resultant CO2 from continuous gas extraction wasdried and coulometrically titrated on a model 5011 UIC coulometer.  The coulometer was adjusted to give a maximum titration current of 50 mA, and it wasrun in the counts mode [the number of pulses or counts generated by thecoulometer's voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC)] during the time the titrationwas displayed and acquired by the computer.  In the coulometer cell, the acid(hydroxyethylcarbamic acid) formed from the reaction of CO2 and ethanolamine wastitrated coulometrically (electrolytic generation of OH-) with photometricendpoint detection.  The product of the time and the current passed through thecell during the titration was related by Faraday's constant to the number ofmoles of OH- generated and thus to the moles of CO2 that reacted withethanolamine to form the acid.  The age of each titration cell was logged fromits birth (time that electrical current was applied to the cell) until its death(time when the current was turned off).  The age was measured from birth(chronological age) and in mass of carbon (mgC) titrated since birth (carbonage).  The systems were controlled with PCs equipped with RS232 serial ports forthe coulometer and the barometer, a 24-line digital input/output (I/O) card forthe solid state relays and valves, and an analog-to-digital (A/D) card for thetemperature, conductivity, and pressure sensors.  These sensors monitored thetemperature of the sample pipette, gas sample loops, and, in some cases, thecoulometer cell.  The controlling software was written in GWBASIC Version 3.20(Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.), and the instruments were driven from anoptions menu appearing on the PC monitor.The TD volume (Vcal) of the sample pipettes was determined gravimetrically priorto the cruise and periodically during the cruise by collecting aliquots ofdeionized water dispensed from the pipette into pre-weighed serum bottles whichwere sealed and re-weighed on shore. The apparent weight of water collected(Wair), corrected to the mass in vacuo (Mvac), was divided by the density of thecalibration fluid at the calibration temperature to give Vcal.  The samplevolume (Vt) at the pipette temperature was calculated from the expression                     V(t) = V(cal) [1 + a(v) (t - t(cal))] ,where av is the coefficient of volumetric expansion for Pyrex-type glass(1 X 10(^-5)/°C), and t is the temperature of the pipette at the time of ameasurement.  Vcal for the Indian Ocean CO2 survey cruises and a chronology ofthe pipette volume determinations appear in Appendix B.The coulometers were electronically calibrated at BNL prior to the cruises andrecalibrated periodically during the cruises (Sections I8SI9S and I5WI4) tocheck the factory calibration as described in Johnson et al. (1993) and DOE(1994).  The results for the electronic intercepts (Intec) and slopes (Slopeec)are given in Appendix B.  For all titrations, the micromoles of carbon titrated(M) was      M = [Counts/4824.45 - (Blank x T(t)) - (Int(ec) x T(i))]/Slope(ec) ,where 4824.45 (counts/µmol) was the scaling factor obtained from the factorycalibration, T(t) was the length of the titration in minutes, Blank is thesystem blank in µmol/min, and T(i) the time of continuous current flow inminutes.The SOMMA-coulometry systems were calibrated daily with pure CO2 (calibrationgas) by titrating the mass of CO2 contained in two stainless steel gas sampleloops of known volume and by analyzing CRM samples supplied by Dr. AndrewDickson of the SIO.  The ratio of the calculated (known) mass of CO2 containedin the gas sample loops to the mass determined coulometrically was the CALFAC(~1.004).  A complete history of the calibration results appears in Appendix B.For water and CRM samples, TCO2 concentration in µmol/kg was                  TCO2 = M x CALFAC x [1 / (V(t) x ñ)] x d(Hg) ,where p is the density of seawater in g/mL at the analytical t and S calculatedfrom the equation of state given by Millero and Poisson (1981), and d(Hg) is thecorrection for sample dilution with bichloride solution (for the cruises d(Hg) =1.000666).System 006 was equipped with a conductance cell (Model SBE-4, Sea-BirdElectronics, Bellevue, Wash.) for the determination of salinity as described byJohnson et al. (1993).  Whenever possible, SOMMA and CTD salinities werecompared to identify mis-trips or other anomalies, but the bottle salinities(furnished by the chief scientist) have been used to calculate p throughout.Three CRM batches were used for the Indian Ocean Survey.  The certified TCO2concentrations were determined by vacuum-extraction/manometry in the laboratoryof C.D. Keeling at SIO and are given in Table 8.TABLE 8: Certified salinity, TALK, and TCO2 for CRM supplied for Indian Ocean         CO2 survey         _________________________________________________          Batch  Salinity  TCO2 (µmol/kg)  TALK (µmol/kg)          -----  --------  --------------  --------------           23     33.483      1993.10         2212.70           26     33.258      1978.34         2176.60           27     33.209      1988.10         2214.90         _________________________________________________Optimal cell and platinum electrode configurations, according to criteria givenin Appendix B, were selected on the first section (I8S) and were used on allsubsequent cruises.The quality control-quality assurance (QC-QA) of the coulometric TCO2 determina-tions was assessed from analyses of 983 CRM samples during the nine Indian OceanCO2 survey cruises.  For both coulometric titration systems (004 and 006) theaverage TCO2 (measurement minus CRM value) for the whole survey was 0.86 µmol/kgand the standard deviation was ±1.21 µmol/kg.  A cruise-by-cruise breakdown ofthe accuracy and precision of the CRM analyses is given in Appendix B.The small mean difference between the analyzed and certified TCO2 and the veryhigh precision (1.21 µmol/kg) of the differences indicates that the two systemsgave very accurate and virtually identical results over the entire survey (seealso Fig. 6 in Appendix B).The second phase of the QC-QA procedure was an assessment of sample precision,which is presented in Table 9.  The sample precision was determined fromduplicate samples analyzed on each system during sections I8SI9S at thebeginning of the survey and I4I5W about half way through the survey.  The pooledstandard deviation (Sp2), shown in Table 9, is the square root of the pooledvariance according to Youden (1951) where K is the number of samples with onereplicate analyzed on each system, n is the total number of replicates analyzedfrom K samples, and n - K is the degree of freedom (d.f.) for the calculation.Precision was calculated this way because TCO2 was analyzed on two differentsystems, and an estimate of sample precision independent of the analyticalsystem was required.  Hence Sp2 is the most conservative estimate of precisionand includes all sources of random and systematic error (bias).  Bias betweensystems would increase the imprecision of the measurements, but the excellentagreement between the Sp2 values for natural seawater samples (Table 9) and thehigh precision of the CRM differences confirms the virtually uniform response,accuracy, and high precision of both systems during the survey.  This findingconfirms that the precision of the TCO2 analyses during the Indian Ocean CO2survey was ±1.20 µmol/kg.TABLE 9: Precision of discrete TCO2 analyses during Indian Ocean CO2 survey                        _____________________________                         Section  Sp2  (K,  n,  d.f)                         -------  ------------------                         I8SI9S   1.26 (15, 30, 15)                         I4I5W    0.91 (21, 42, 21)                         CRM      1.21                        _____________________________The next phase of the QC-QA procedure was the comparison of replicate samplesanalyzed at sea and in the shore-based laboratory.  Samples from every cruisewere analyzed at sea by continuous gas extraction/coulometry, and later, afterstorage, duplicate samples were analyzed on shore by vacuum extraction/manome-try.  The results of the analyses are summarized in Table 10.TABLE 10: Mean Difference [TCO2(S-SIO)] and standard deviation of the dif-          ferences [S.D.(S-SIO)] between at-sea TCO2 by coulometry and on-          shore TCO2 by manometry on aliquots of the same sample from Indian           Ocean CO2 survey, and the mean replicate precision [S.D.(SIO)] of           the manometric analyses          __________________________________________________________________           Section  Pairs Analyzed  TCO2(S-SIO)  S.D.(S-SIO)  S.D.(SIO) (a)                         (n)         (µmol/kg)    (µmol/kg)    (µmol/kg)           -------  --------------  -----------  -----------  -------------           I8SI9S         23           -4.14        1.80          0.82           I9N            24           -1.96        1.67          0.80           I8NI5E         17           -4.80        2.87          1.31           I3             29           -3.29        1.26          0.82           I4I5W          16           -2.95        1.40          1.30           I7N            13           -5.37        1.92          1.40           I1             26           -5.59        1.38          1.05           I10             8           -4.94        1.52          1.28           I2             10           -4.42        1.50          0.83           n             166            9           9             9           ----------------------------------------------------------------           Mean                        -4.16        1.70          1.07           S.D.                         1.21        0.49          0.25          __________________________________________________________________           (a) Each on-shore TCO2 by manometry is always the mean of two               analyses (see text).In general, the reproducibility and the uniformity of the data as a whole, andspecifically, the high precision of the manometric analyses shown in Table 10,indicate that the collection and return of the "Keeling samples" wassuccessfully performed by each of the measurement groups.  Poor sampling orstorage techniques would probably have been manifested in a much higherimprecision for the on-shore replicate analyses and in the differences betweenthe at-sea and on-shore analyses.  However, the negative mean difference (4.16 ±1.21, n = 9) for the Indian Ocean sections was greater than the mean differencefor WOCE sections in other oceans (-1.36 ± 1.37 µmol/kg, n = 22).  The accuracyof the CRM analyses, the tendency for the coulometric analyses to give slightlylower results, and the reproducibility of the at-sea and on-shore differencesare similar everywhere, but the magnitude of the Indian Ocean difference isclearly the largest observed to date.  Even if the consistent and slightlynegative difference for the CRM is taken into account (-0.86 µmol/kg), the at-sea coulometric measurements are approximately 2 µmol/kg lower than themanometric method.  A suite of samples from the 1997 North Atlantic sectionsremains to be analyzed.  Until these analyses are completed and a thoroughstatistical evaluation of the entire CO2 survey data set is made, theexplanation of the at-sea and on-shore differences, including those found forthe Indian Ocean, is not possible.An additional step in the QA-QC was also undertaken.  Inspection of Fig. 1 showspoints where the cruise tracks cross or nearly cross.  The agreement betweenTCO2 measurements made at these crossover locations (± 100 km) on differentcruises was examined by assuming that the temporal and spatial variations indeep-ocean TCO2 are small relative to the measurement accuracy and precision.Hence, deep ocean waters should have the same TCO2 at different times in theabsence of internal vertical motion, and because deep ocean motion probablyoccurs along constant density surfaces (isopycnals), the comparisons of TCO2measurements were made with reference to density and not depth.  Appendixes Band D (Johnson at al. 1998 and Sabine et al. 1999) give a complete descriptionof the statistical procedures used to make the crossover comparisons.  Briefly,crossover points were selected for comparison of water samples collected below2500 m.  A smooth curve was fit through the TCO2 data as a function of thedensity anomaly referenced to 3000 dbar (sigma3) using Cleveland's LOESSsmoother (Cleveland and Devlin 1988).  A separate fit was performed for the datacollected at each of the two intersecting crossover points, but the same tensionparameter was used for all of the crossover points so that the smoothingfunction was consistently applied to all crossover locations.  The differencebetween the two smoothed curves was evaluated at 50 evenly spaced pointscovering the density range where the two data sets overlapped.  A mean andstandard deviation for the 50 comparisons was calculated for each crossoverpoint.  For TCO2, differences never exceeded 3 µmol/kg, and the overall mean andstandard deviation of the differences was -0.78 ± 1.74 µmol/kg.  The latterdifferences were consistent with the overall precision of the CRM analyses (±1.2 µmol/kg).Tables 8 10 show an internally consistent TCO2 data set for the Indian Oceanwith excellent accuracy with respect to the CRM certified values, consistentlygood precision, no analytical bias between the coulometric titration systems,and crossover agreement to within the precision of the method.  However, theagreement between the at-sea and on-shore analyses is not as good as for earlierWOCE sections from other oceans (i.e., the Pacific and the South Atlantic).Based on the accuracy of the CRM analyses and the high precision of the sampleanalyses, the TCO2 data were not corrected in any way and were deemed to meetsurvey criteria for accuracy and precision.3.3.  Total Alkalinity MeasurementsTotal alkalinity was measured on 18,928 samples using two closed-cell automatedpotentiometric titration systems (hereafter designated as MATS) developed at theUniversity of Miami.  The MATS are described by Millero et al. (1993) and byMillero et al. (1998).  The latter reprinted in Appendix C of this document,completely describes the Indian Ocean Survey TALK measurements and results.Briefly, the MATS consisted of three parts: a water-jacketed, fixed-volume(about 200 mL determined to ± 0.05 mL) closed Plexiglass sample cell, a Metrohmmodel 665 Dosimat titrator, and a pH meter (Orion, Model 720A), the last twocontrolled by a PC.  The titration cell was similar to those used by Bradshawand Brewer (1988), but had a greater volume to improve the precision of themeasurements.  The cell was equipped with flush-mounted fill and drain valves toincrease the reproducibility of the cell volume.  The cell, titrant burette, andsample container were held at a temperature of 25 ± 0.01°C using a constanttemperature bath (e.g., Neslab, Model RTE 221).A Lab Windows C program was used to run the titrators, record the volume oftitrant added, and record the measured electromagnetic fields (emf) of theelectrodes through RS232 serial interfaces.  Two electrodes were used in eachcell: a ROSS glass pH electrode (Orion, Model 810100) and a double-junctionAg/AgCl reference electrode (Orion, Model 900200).  The specific electrodes usedduring the Indian Ocean survey were selected after careful screening for non-Nernstian behavior.  Only those electrodes which gave TCO2 results in goodagreement with TCO2, as determined coulometrically, were used (Sect. 3.2).Seawater samples were titrated by adding increments of HCl until the carbonicacid endpoint of the titration was exceeded.  During a titration, the emfreadings were monitored until they were stable (± 0.09 mV).  Sufficient volumeof acid was added to increase the emf by preassigned increment (~13 mV) in orderto give an even distribution of data points over the course of a full titration,which consists of 25 data points.  A single titration takes about 20 min.  AFORTRAN computer program based on those developed by Dickson (1981) and byJohansson and Wedborg (1982) was used to calculate the carbonate parameters.The pH and pK of the acids used in the program are on the seawater scale, andthe dissociation constants for carbonic acid were taken from Dickson and Millero(1987).  For further details see Appendix C and DOE (1994).The titrant (acid) used throughout the cruises was prepared prior to the cruise,standardized, and stored in 500-mL borosilicate glass bottles for use in thefield.  The 0.25-M HCl acid solution was prepared by dilution of 1-M HCl in0.45-M NaCl to yield a solution with total ionic strength similar to that ofseawater of salinity 35.0 (I = 0.7 M).  The acid was standardized by coulometry(Taylor and Smith 1959; Marinenko and Taylor 1968), and was also checked byindependent titration in A. Dickson's laboratory at SIO.  The independentdeterminations agreed to ± 0.0001 M, which corresponds to an uncertainty in TALKof ~ 1 µmol/kg.  The Dosimat titrator burettes were calibrated with Milli-Qwater at 25°C to ± 0.0005 mL.While CRM samples were available to the TCO2 analysts from the beginning of themeasurement program in 1990, the Indian Ocean cruises were the first to have acertified alkalinity standard as well.  Hence, the accuracy of the method waschecked in the laboratory by analyzing CRM samples from batches 23, 24, 26, 27,29, and 30 and comparing the analyzed values with the certified TALK determinedby A. Dickson at SIO (in the same manner as for TCO2).  These results aresummarized in Table 11 (see also Appendix C).  The mean difference between theMATS measurements in the laboratory and the certified TALK values was -0.8µmol/kg for CRM samples with a concentration range approximately one-half aslarge as the range of a typical seawater profile.  The excellent agreementindicated that the CRM concept for alkalinity was valid and that the methodologyfor TALK was ready for the Indian Ocean survey.  The results for the at-seameasurements of the CRM samples have been extracted from Table 2 of Appendix C,summarized, and are given in Table 12.TABLE 11: Mean analytical difference (TALK) between analyzed and certified          TALK for CRM used during Indian Ocean CO2 survey          ____________________________________________________________________           Batch  Salinity   Certified values    MATS mean TALK   delta TALK                               TCO2     TALK        (µmol/kg)    (MATS - CRM)                            (µmol/kg) (µmol/kg)           -----  --------  --------- ---------  --------------  ------------            23     33.483    1993.10   2212.7        2213.7          1.0            24     33.264    1987.53   2215.5        2215.8          0.3            26     33.258    1978.34   2176.6        2175.1         -1.5            27     33.209    1988.10   2214.9        2214.3         -0.6            29     33.701    1902.33   2184.8        2182.3         -2.5            30     33.420    1988.78   2201.9        2200.5         -1.4           Range    0.492      90.77     38            40.7          3.5           Mean                                                     -0.8          ____________________________________________________________________The analytical differences are for the most part within the precision of themeasurements (~ 2-5 µmol/kg) except for the I7N Section.  The larger at-seadifferences were attributed to operator error or procedures and to uncertaintiesin the volume of cells, especially after repairs due to leakage, breakage, orrepositioning the electrodes after changing the inner filling solutions.Variations between different MATS systems used on a single cruise were correctedusing the adjustments required to reproduce the values assigned for the CRM (seeTable 11).  The at-sea sample titrations were corrected using the results of theat-sea CRM analyses.  For TALK, the calibration factor (CF) used to correct theat sea measurements was                 CF = TALK (meas., CRM) - CRM (certified value),and the corrected TALK (TALKc) was                (TALKc) = TALK (meas., Spl) x [ CRM / (CRM + CF)],where CRM was the certified TALK and Spl was the measured sample TALK.The overall precision of TALK determinations during the Indian Ocean survey was± 4.2 µmol/kg.  The precision of the potentiometric pH and TCO2 measurements aregiven in Table 3 of Appendix C.TABLE 12: Mean analytical difference (TALK) between analyzed and certified          TALK for each section during Indian Ocean CO2 survey          _____________________________________________________________           Batch  Section  Certified  MATS mean   S.D.

The agreement between the corrected TALK measurements made at thecrossover locations (± 100 km) on different cruises was examined by assumingthat the temporal and spatial variations of the deep-ocean TALK were smallrelative to measurement accuracy and precision.  Hence, deep ocean waters shouldhave the same TALK at different times in the absence of internal verticalmotion, and because deep ocean motion probably occurs along constant-densitysurfaces (isopycnals), the comparisons of TALK measurements were made withreference to density and not depth.  Appendixes C and D give a description of the statistical procedures used to make the crossover comparisons.  For watersamples collected below 2500 m, a smooth curve was fit through the TALK data asa function of the density anomaly referenced to 3000 dbar (sigma3) usingCleveland's LOESS smoother (Cleveland and Devlin 1988).  A separate fit wasperformed on the data collected at each of the two intersecting crossoverpoints, with the same tension parameter being used for all of the crossovers sothat the smoothing function was consistently applied.  The difference betweenthe two smoothed curves was evaluated at 50 evenly-spaced points covering thedensity range where the two data sets overlapped.  Mean and standard deviationsfor the differences at the 50 points were calculated for each crossover point.For TALK, differences never exceeded 6 µmol/kg, and the overall mean andstandard deviation of the differences was 2.1 ± 2.1 µmol/kg.  The latter wereconsistent with the overall precision of the CRM analyses (± 4 µmol/kg).Table 13 is a final summation of the inorganic carbon analytical work completedduring the Indian Ocean CO2 survey from 1994 to 1996.TABLE 13: Final count of carbonate system parameter (CSP) analyses during          Indian Ocean CO2 survey                      _______________________________________                                   No. of CSP determinations                       Parameters   Discrete   CRM   Total                       ----------   --------  -----  ------                        TCO2         18,963     983  19,946                        TALK         18,928     949  19,877                        Total        37,891   1,932  39,823                      ______________________________________3.4.  Carbon Data Synthesis and AnalysisIn accordance with one of the stated goals of the program, an evaluation of thedata set with respect to estimated anthropogenic CO2 distributions in the IndianOcean has been completed and published by Sabine et al. (1999) (see Appendix D).The document is appended to this report as Appendix D.  Additional crossovercomparisons of the survey data with data gathered in the 1980s and in 1993 byFrench scientists are included.  Briefly, the sequestering of anthropogenic CO2has been estimated by comparing the Indian Ocean survey results with the IndianOcean GEOSECS expedition data from 1977 to 1978.  Although CRM samples were notavailable for evaluating the earlier data, statistical methods were used to fitthese data and correct for calibration offsets so that they could be comparedwith the current survey data.  The data analysis was complicated by regions ofpronounced denitrification (Arabian basin) and other regional variations thathad to be considered and quantified.  In summary, the estimate of theanthropogenic inventory was relatively small in the Indian and Southern Oceans,with anthropogenic carbon uptake lower by a factor of 2 compared to that of theAtlantic Ocean.  Importantly, discrepancies between model and data-basedestimates were found especially for the Southern Ocean where carbon uptakeappears to have been traditionally overestimated by the extant circulationmodels. (See Appendix D for further details.)  The initial data synthesis workindicates that the survey data will provide an important baseline with respectto future studies and that the spatial distribution of anthropogenic carbon canbe an important tool for understanding model-based carbon uptake estimates andthe response of models to atmospheric increases in CO2.3.5.  Radiocarbon MeasurementsFull information on the radiocarbon measurement method, instrumentation, andresults can be found in Appendix E of this document.4.  DATA CHECKS AND PROCESSING PERFORMED BY CDIACAn important part of the numeric data packaging process at the Carbon DioxideInformation Analysis Center (CDIAC) involves the quality assurance (QA) of databefore  distribution.  Data received at CDIAC are rarely in a condition thatwould permit immediate distribution, regardless of the source.  To guaranteedata of the highest possible quality, CDIAC  conducts extensive QA reviews thatinvolve examining the data for completeness, reasonableness, and accuracy.  TheQA process is a critical component in the value-added concept of supplyingaccurate, usable data for researchers.The following information summarizes the data processing and QA checks performedby CDIAC on the data obtained during the R/V Knorr cruise along WOCE SectionsI8SI9S, I9N, I8NI5E, I3, I5WI4, I7N, I1, I10, and I2  in the Indian Ocean.1.  The final carbon-related data were provided to CDIAC by the ocean carbon    measurement PIs listed in Table 5.  The final hydrographic and chemical    measurements and the station information files were provided by the WOCE    Hydrographic Program Office (WHPO) after quality evaluation.  A FORTRAN 90    retrieval code was written and used to merge and reformat all data files.2.  Every measured parameter for each station was plotted vs depth (pressure) to    identify questionable outliers using the Ocean Data View (ODV) software    (Schlitzer 2001) Station Mode (Fig. 3).3.  The section plots for every parameter were generated using the ODV's Section    Mode in order to map a general distribution of each property along all     Indian Ocean sections (Fig. 4).4.  To identify "noisy" data and possible systematic, methodological errors,    property-property plots for all parameters were generated (Fig. 5),     carefully examined, and compared with plots from previous expeditions in the     Indian Ocean.5.  All variables were checked for values exceeding physical limits, such as    sampling depth values that are greater than the given bottom depths.6.  Dates, times, and coordinates were checked for bogus values (e.g., values of    MONTH < 1 or > 12; DAY < 1 or > 31; YEAR < 1994 or > 1996; TIME < 0000 or >    2400; LATITUDE <  70.000 or > 60.000; LONGITUDE < 19.000 or > 119.000.7.  Station locations (latitudes and longitudes) and sampling times were     examined for consistency with maps and cruise information supplied by PIs.8.  The designation for missing values, given as  9.0 in the original files, was    changed to  999.9 for the consistency with other oceanographic data sets.6.  REFERENCESArmstrong, F.A.J., C.R.

The systems were used by six different measurement groups on 10 WHP Cruises beginning in December 1994 and ending in January 1996. A total of 18,828 individual samples were analyzed for TCO2 during the survey. This paper assesses the analytical quality of these data and the effect of several key factors on instrument performance. Data quality is assessed from the accuracy and precision of certified reference material (CRM) analyses from three different CRM batches. The precision of the method was 1.2 µmol/kg. The mean and standard deviation of the differences between the known TCO2 for the CRM (certified value) and the CRM TCO2 determined by SOMMA-coulometry were -0.91±0.58 (n=470) and -1.01±0.44 (n=513) µmol/kg for systems I and II, respectively, representing an accuracy of 0.05% for both systems. Measurements of TCO2 made on 12 crossover stations during the survey agreed to within 3 µmol/kg with an overall mean and standard deviation of the differences of -0.78±1.74 µmol/kg (n=600). The crossover results are therefore consistent with the precision of the CRM analyses. After 14 months of nearly continuous use, the accurate and the virtually identical performance statistics for the two systems indicate that the cooperative survey effort was extraordinarily successful and will yield a high quality data set capable of fulfilling the objectives of the survey.AUTHOR KEYWORDS: total carbon dioxide (TCO2); single-operator multiparameter                  metabolic analyzers (SOMMA) coulometry; marine studiesINDEX TERMS:     reproductive toxicity; boronARTICLE OUTLINE1.

INTRODUCTIONBetween 1990 and 1997 an international effort was made to determine the global oceanic distribution of inorganic carbon in conjunction with the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Programme (WHP). This effort is referred to as the Global Survey of CO2 in the oceans, and it is an integral part of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). The goals of this survey are to:1. Accurately determine the oceanic distribution of dissolved inorganic carbon,2. Quantify the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide by the oceans to better    predict future atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,3. Provide a global description of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the oceans to    aid development of a 3-dimensional model of the oceanic carbon cycle,4. Characterize the transport of carbon dioxide between the ocean and the    atmosphere and the large scale (e.g., meridional) transports of carbon    dioxide within the ocean.The survey has acquired a global data set of profile measurements of dissolved carbon dioxide parameters on both zonal and meridional oceanographic transects throughout the world's oceans. With reference to program goals, Bates et al. (1996) found that for mixed layer waters the average rate of increase in CO2 concentration due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 was 1.7 µmol/kg/yr (<0.1%). This rate of increase establishes a natural target for the accuracy of the TCO2 measurements. The distribution of this 'excess' CO2 signal is not uniform spatially, and it is masked by variability in CO2 concentrations arising from natural biological and physicochemical processes. Hence, the goals of the program imply that measurements must be extremely accurate (0.1% or better) and spatially extensive. A large part of the US contribution to this survey has been conducted by a team of investigators supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE). This team has developed certified reference materials (Dickson, 1990), instrumentation (Johnson and Wallace, 1992), a set of standard operating procedures (DOE, 1994) and, to a large extent, shared a common approach to the measurement program.This paper presents the DOE team effort which sampled the Indian Ocean for inorganic carbon during the course of approximately 1 year. All the measurements were made aboard a single research vessel during sequential cruises which allowed the investigators to share equipment and procedures to an unprecedented extent. This paper concentrates on estimating the accuracy of the shipboard determinations of the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration of seawater. This parameter was established at the onset of the survey as the primary carbonate system parameter because its concentration should change in response to anthropogenic CO2 uptake and it had the highest potential for measurement accuracy. Our results highlight some factors which affect the accuracy of this measurement. The Indian Ocean Survey aboard the R/V Knorr encompassed the cruise legs shown in Fig. 1 in the sequence given in Table 1. Fig. 1 also gives the location of the crossover points (cruise track intersections) where comparisons of the reproducibility of the TCO2 analyses were made. The six survey groups measured two water column carbonate system parameters, total dissolved carbon dioxide (TCO2) and total alkalinity (TA), and assisted with the operation of an underway pCO2 (surface) system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. PREPARATIONSThe total carbon dioxide concentration (TCO2) was determined using two single-operator multiparameter metabolic analyzers (SOMMA) each connected to a Model 5011 coulometer (UIC, Joliet, IL 60434). Descriptions of the SOMMA-coulometer system and its calibration can be found in the works of Johnson (1995), Johnson and Wallace (1992), and Johnson et al. (1987) and Johnson et al. (1993). A schematic diagram of the SOMMA is shown in Fig. 2, and further details concerning the coulometric titration can be found in the works of Huffman (1977) and Johnson et al. (1985). Briefly, seawater fills an automated to-deliver sample pipette. The contents of the pipette are pneumatically injected into a stripping chamber containing approximately 1.2 cm3 of 8.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid, and the resultant CO2 is extracted, dried, and coulometrically titrated. Calibration is performed by titrating known masses of pure CO2 and checked by analyzing certified reference material (CRM). The coulometers were adjusted to give a maximum titration current of 50 mA, and they were run in the counts mode (the number of pulses or counts generated by the coulometer's voltage to frequency converter during the titration is displayed). In the coulometer cell, the acid (hydroxyethylcarbamic acid) formed from the reaction of CO2 and ethanolamine is titrated coulometrically (electrolytic generation of OH¯) with photometric endpoint detection. The systems were equipped with conductance cells (Model SBE-4, Sea-Bird Electronics, Bellevue, WA) for measuring salinity as described by Johnson et al. (1993).Fig. 2.  SOMMA-coulometer system schematic. Carbon dioxide extracted from a          water sample (I) or from volume-calibrated gas sample loops filled at a          known pressure and temperature is degassed from the stripper (IV),          dried (V), and coulometrically titrated (VI). The water sample is          pneumatically injected from the pipette (II) into the stripper, and the          pure CO2 contained in the gas loops is delivered to the stripper from          an 8-port chromatography valve (VII) equipped with pressure and          temperature sensors. Salinity is measured using a conductance cell          (III) integrated into the SOMMA chassis. The pipette and conductance          cell are thermostatted and equipped with temperature sensors.The DOE supported the construction of nine SOMMA-coulometer systems for the US CO2 Survey Measurement Groups in the early 1990's (Johnson and Wallace, 1992), and two of these systems from the DOE instrument pool were set up aboard the R/V Knorr in Fremantle, Australia on November 28, 1994. Before they were shipped to Australia, the temperature sensors were calibrated, the glassware was chemically cleaned and gravimetrically calibrated, the gas sample loop volumes were calibrated according to the procedure of Wilke et al. (1993), the coulometers were electronically calibrated (Johnson et al., 1993; DOE, 1994), and system accuracy was verified with CRM at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The same two systems (hereafter called I and II) were used by all measuring groups. A backup system (from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) was onboard but was not used. Pre-cruise preparations also included a training session for participants at the University of Miami in September 19-23, 1994.Referring to Fig. 2, the analytical gases included UHP nitrogen (99.998%) for carrier and pneumatic gases, compressed air for the headspace gas, and analytical grade CO2 (99.995%) from Scott Speciality Gases (South Plainfield, NJ) for the calibration gas. The survey began with the use of compressed gases, but prior to leg I8N in April 1995, a N2 generator (TOC Model 1500, Peak Scientific, Chicago, IL) was placed into service. The generator provided N2 (99.9995%, hydrocarbons<0.1 ppm, CO2<1.0 ppm) for carrier and pneumatic gases to both systems for the remainder of the survey. Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents remain as described by Johnson et al. (1993).The BNL measurement group supplied 7 side-arm type glass titration cells (UIC, PN 200-034), 7 silver electrodes (PN 101-033), and 5 rubber cell caps (PN 192-005). A platinum electrode (PN 101-034), temperature sensor (PN LM34CH, National Semiconductor, Santa Clara, CA), and a teflon inlet tube were mounted in each cap. Together, the cell and cap comprise the cell assembly shown in Fig. 3. For this paper, each cell assembly is assigned an 'age' or lifetime which is measured in minutes (chronological age) or by the mass of carbon titrated in mg C (carbon age) from the time when current is first applied to the assembly (cell birth) until the current is turned off (cell death). The software continuously records the chronological and carbon ages.Fig. 3.  The titration cell assembly and the cathodic and anodic half reactions          for the coulometric titration of the H+ from the acid formed by the          reaction of CO2 and ethanolamine.2.2. SELECTION OF CELL ASSEMBLIESThe performance of individual cell assemblies (Fig. 3) varies widely (K.M. Johnson, unpublished data). Unacceptable assemblies exhibit high blanks, prolonged blank determinations (>2 h), reduced accuracy or precision, or become noisy early in their lifetime. Acceptable assemblies stabilize quickly (within 60 min) and function well for periods exceeding 24 h. Cell behavior will be discussed elsewhere, but our experience suggests several factors play a role: quality of the reagents; quality (purity) of the carrier gases; damage to the platinum electrode; and perhaps the porosity of the cell frit. Therefore, a systematic effort was made at the beginning of leg I8SI9S to select satisfactorily performing cell assemblies using pretested reagents and carrier gas sources known to be uncontaminated. During this first leg, the assemblies on hand were evaluated for conformance to the following empirical criteria.(1) Cell assemblies should attain a blank of ≤0.005 µmol C/min within 90 min of     cell birth. Satisfactory assemblies usually exhibit a 15-25% decline in the     blank with each successive determination.(2) The gas calibration factor, which is the ratio of an accurately known mass     of CO2 to the mass of this gas determined coulometrically, should be     1.004±0.0015 (recoveries of 99.6%).(3) Titrations of CO2 extracted from gas sample loops (gas calibration) or     pipettes of 20 cm3 (sample analysis) should take 9-12 min.(4) Cell assemblies, which repeatedly exhibit titrations longer than 20 min (no     endpoint) before their carbon age reached 30 mg C titrated, were considered     defective. An occasional failure to attain an endpoint after the carbon age     exceeds 30 mg C was interpreted to mean that the cell frit required cleaning     with 6 N HNO3 and retesting.Based on these criteria, three assemblies (2 primary and a third as backup) were found to be acceptable during the first leg, and these assemblies were used throughout the survey (at the midpoint of the survey an additional assembly was placed into service).2.3. AT-SEA OPERATIONSThe following TCO2 sampling and measurement practices were followed throughout the survey.(1) The daily sequence of analytical operations for each system as described in     the SOMMA operator's manual (Johnson, 1995) consisted of changing the cells     and drying agents, determining the blank, running test seawater samples,     calibrating the system using pure CO2 (gas calibration), analyzing samples,     and analyzing certified reference material (CRM) at the beginning and end of     the cell lifetime.(2) A complete deep vertical profile for TCO2 and TA consisted of 36 samples. A     lesser number of samples were drawn at shallower stations. Complete profiles     were taken at every other station, and if time permitted, additional     truncated profiles (0-1000 m) were taken. TCO2 samples always coincided with     14C samples. Samples were drawn from 10-l Niskin bottles according to DOE     (1994).(3) Samples for TCO2 were collected in 300 cm3 BOD-type glass bottles. They were     poisoned with a saturated HgCl(2) solution (200-400 µl) upon collection. The     appropriate correction factors for dilution were applied by the measurement     groups according to DOE (1994).(4) Sample bottles were rinsed and then allowed to overflow by at least 1/2     volume before poisoning. Prior to April 1995, a glass stopper was inserted     into the full BOD bottle. After April 1995, a headspace of approximately 4     cm3 was created before poisoning and stoppering. This was done in a     reproducible manner by squeezing the filling tube shut before withdrawing it     from the bottle. This change was made to ensure that no HgCl(2) was     displaced by the stopper, and to allow for water expansion. The gas-liquid     phase ratio was approximately 1.3%. A correction (±0.5 µmol/kg) for the     reequilibration of the liquid with the gas phase was applied by the     measurement groups according to DOE (1994).(5) To estimate sample precision, duplicate samples were normally collected at     surface, mid depth, and at the deepest depth. The duplicate analyses were     interspersed with the analysis of the other profile samples with a minimum     of 2 h and up to 12 h between duplicate analyses. Because the duplicate     analyses were separated in time, these data could potentially detect drift     (decreased precision) as the cell aged. Every effort was made to run each     station profile on a single cell assembly, and to limit the cell lifetime to     ≤35 mg C.(6) Although salinity was determined by the SOMMA-coulometer systems, post-    cruise sample density was calculated using bottle salinities supplied by the     chief scientists. However, SOMMA-based salinities were often compared to the     real-time CTD salinities to spot bottle mistrips during the taking of the     vertical profiles. The agreement between SOMMA-based and CTD salinities was     ±0.02 or better.(7) To monitor the volume of the SOMMA pipettes, they were periodically filled     with deionized water at known temperatures, and their output collected in     preweighed serum bottles. The bottles were sealed immediately and stored     until they were reweighed at BNL on a model R300S (Sartorius, Göttingen,     Germany) balance. The mass of water corrected for buoyancy was used to     calculate the to-deliver pipette volume (V(cal), Eq. 3) according to DOE     (1994).(8) After use, cells were cleaned with deionized water followed by an acetone     rinse of the glass frit. Before reuse, they were dried at 55°C for at least     12 h. Cell caps and the platinum electrodes were thoroughly washed with     deionized water and dried at 55°C for at least 6 h before reuse.(9) Duplicate samples from approximately 3000 m and 20 m were regularly     collected for shore-based reference analyses of TCO2 by vacuum     extraction/manometry by C.D. Keeling at the Scripps Institution of     Oceanography (SIO). Between 2 and 5% of the samples analyzed at sea will be     analyzed at SIO and reported elsewhere.2.4. CALCULATION OF RESULTSFor the coulometric determination, the mass of carbon titrated from CO2 extracted from the gas sample loops or a water sample in µmol of carbon is given by M according to:      M=[Counts/4824.45-(Blank x t(t))-(Int(ec) x t(i))]/Slope(ec),     (1)where Counts is the coulometer display, i.e., the number of pulses accumulated by the coulometer's voltage to frequency circuit (VFC); 4824.45 (counts/µmol) is a scaling factor derived from the factory calibration of the VFC and the value of the Faraday (96,485.309 C/mol); Blank is the system blank in µmol/min; t(t) is the length of the titration in minutes; Int(ec) is the intercept from the electronic calibration of the coulometer; ti is the duration (min) of continuous current flow, and Slope(ec) is the slope from electronic calibration (Johnson et al., 1993; DOE, 1994). Electronic calibration serves as a check of the factory calibration. If the coulometer was perfectly calibrated, the slope and intercept would be 1 and 0, respectively. Typically, minor deviations from the theoretical slope (0.998-0.999) and intercept (0.001-0.01) are observed. The water sample TCO2 concentration in µmol/kg is calculated from:               TCO2 = M x Calibration Factor x 1/(V(t)p))D+∆TCO(2),     (2)where VT is the sample volume (to-deliver volume of the SOMMA pipette) calculated from:                          V(T)=V(cal)[1+a(v)(T-T(cal)],                 (3)and T is the analytical temperature; V(cal) is the calibrated volume of the pipette at the calibration temperature, T(cal); av is the coefficient of volumetric expansion for Pyrex glass (1.0 x 10(^-5)/deg). In Eq. 2, Calibration Factor is the gas calibration factor (see Eq. 4); p is the density of seawater from the seawater equation of state (Millero and Poisson, 1981) at the sample salinity and T; D is the correction due to dilution of the sample with HgCl(2) preservative; ∆TCO2 is the correction for the repartitioning of CO2 into the sample headspace according to DOE (1994). Note that correction factors D and ∆TCO2 (Eq. 2) are not incorporated into the SOMMA software and were applied post cruise by the individual measurement groups.The gas calibration factor (Calibration Factor) is the ratio of:                                   M(calc)/M,                           (4)where M(calc) is the mass of CO2 contained in the gas sample loop calculated according to DOE (1994), and M is the coulometric determination of that same mass from Eq. 1.2.5. ASSESSMENT OF ANALYTICAL ACCURACYAnalytical accuracy was assessed by analyzing certified reference materials (CRMs). The CRMs are filtered seawater poisoned with HgCl(2). They are prepared in 500 cm3 bottles at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) according to procedures given by Dickson (1990). The certified TCO2 value is obtained by analyzing a representative number of samples by vacuum extraction/manometry in the laboratory of C.D. Keeling at SIO. For this paper, the term analytical difference refers to the difference between the analyzed (by coulometry) and the certified value of the CRM (by manometry), i.e., at-sea accuracy is estimated from the analyzed TCO2-certified TCO2 differences.2.6. DATA DISTRIBUTIONThe complete data set has been submitted to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). CDIAC will issue a final data report which will detail the procedures for retrieving the data. The overall accuracy given below is considered final at this time, and the estimated precision is expected to remain unchanged. The CDIAC web address is http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov.3. RESULTSDuring the survey, approximately 18,828 separate samples (not counting dupli-cates) for TCO2, and 983 CRM were analyzed on the two systems (A. Kozyr, personal communication, November 1997).3.1. TO-DELIVER PIPETTE VOLUMESome 103 gravimetric determinations of the sample pipette volume were made on 28 separate occasions during the survey (14 on each system). Four of the determina-tions were rejected; two because they were exactly 1 cm3 too high with respect to the survey mean (likely due to failure to correctly note the tare weight determined prior to the cruise), and two because they were inexplicably 0.3% lower than the survey mean volumes (probably due to faulty sealing and evapora-tion). There were no results from leg I8N because the gravimetric samples were collected incorrectly. Volume determinations should have been made at the start, middle, and at the end of each leg, or at least at the beginning and end of each leg. However, for a variety of reasons, this was not always the case. In order to consistently assign a pipette volume to each leg, a leg-specific volume (V(cal)) was obtained by averaging the volume determinations made closest to the beginning and end of the leg along with any made during that leg. Table 2 presents the results for V(cal), and the chronological order of the pipette determinations used to calculate V(cal) are plotted in Fig. 4a for system I and Fig. 4b for system II. This averaging increases the number of determinations used to calculate V(cal), and ensures that V(cal) is based on at least two sets of determinations, separated in time, for all legs except the initial leg (I8SI9S) and leg I10 after the pipette was cleaned. Table 2 and Fig. 4a and b show the timing of events which could conceivably have affected pipette volume. For I8SI9S, the pipette volumes were determined in the laboratory prior to the cruise; however, the volume of system I had to be empirically redetermined at-sea because its pipette was broken during transit. This was done as follows: after replacing the pipette, V(cal) was determined by simultaneously analyzing a replicate from a single seawater sample on systems I and II. Because V(cal) was well known for system II, the TCO2 concentration determined on system II was used to calculate the pipette volume of system I by rearranging Eq. 2 to solve for VT and letting VT be equal to V(cal) for the subsequent analyses on system I during leg I8SI9S. As Table 2 shows, numerous volume determinations were made for both systems I and II on succeeding legs.TABLE 2: The leg-specific to-deliver pipette volume (V(cal)) and the calibration          temperature (T(cal)) for SOMMA-coulometer systems I and II during the          Indian Ocean Survey 1994-1996______________________________________________________________________________ Leg        n     V(cal)       S.D.

The top section of the three-part graphs shows the leg-         specific pipette volumes, V(cal), as horizontal lines corresponding to          the duration of the individual legs, and the relative chronological          order of the means of the individual pipette determinations from which          V(cal) was calculated as open circles placed before, in the middle of,          or following the horizontal lines representing V(cal) (see text and          Table 2 for details). The middle section depicts the mean gas calibra-         tion factors for each leg (horizontal lines), and the bottom section          shows the mean analytical differences for the CRM analyses assuming a          constant pipette volume (V(cal) for leg I8S) for the duration of the          survey (open circles) vs. the leg-specific V(cal) (closed circles). The          error bars through the plot symbols represent the S.D. of the determi-         nations. Procedural changes (introduction of the gas generator,          pressure adjustments, and cleaning) which may have affected pipette          volume are indicated by the arrows.For I10, data from the prior leg could not be used to calculate V(cal) because leg I10 took place after the pipettes had been dismounted for cleaning, which may have altered their volumes. On legs I5WI4 and I7N, replicate volume determinations were made at the beginning, middle, and end of the leg by the same measuring group so that V(cal) for these legs do not include results from preceding or succeeding legs. The survey mean pipette volumes and their standard deviations for systems I and II are 21.4502±0.0032 cm3 at 20.25°C (n=43) and 21.6261±0.0028 cm3 at 20.14°C (n=56), respectively. The pooled standard deviation (sp^2) calculated according to Youden (1951) for the 28 sets of gravimetric determinations is ±0.0042 cm3. Individually, sp^2 for system I is ±0.0049 cm3, and for system II sp^2 is ±0.0036 cm3, suggesting a very slightly higher precision for system II.Significant differences at the 95% confidence level in V(cal) for comparisons between each leg with the succeeding leg were determined by two-tailed t-tests according to Taylor (1990), and are denoted by asterisks in Table 2. For the most part, leg to leg differences in V(cal) are not significant (significance in 2 of 9 comparisons for each instrument), but it should be noted that for both systems, the differences between the initial leg (I8SI9S) pipette volumes and all leg-specific volumes after leg I9N are significant. In both systems, the to-deliver pipette volume declines slightly with time. However, the decline is not consistent between instruments. In system I, significant decreases in volume appear earlier in the survey and may be correlated with the switch to the N2 generator and a documented generator outlet pressure adjustment, but this is not the case with system II where dismounting and cleaning of the pipette late in the survey may have had the greatest effect.TABLE 3: A summary of the mean analytical parameters and mean analytical          differences for the three batches of CRM analyzed on SOMMA-coulometer          systems I and II during the Indian Ocean Survey 1994-1996_____________________________________________________________________________ Leg       Slope     Int     Cal-    CRM   Precision,  Analytical difference           (ec)      (ec)   factor  batch  n(±µmol/kg    const-vp/corr-vp -------   ------  -------  ------  -----  ----------  --------------------- System I  I8SI9S    1.0002   0.0008  1.0043   23     1.15(54)        -0.41/-0.41  I9N       1.0007   0.0013  1.0045   23     0.86(71)        -0.83/-0.20  I8NI5E    1.0007   0.0013  1.0062   23     1.36(55)        -1.71/-0.15  I3        1.0007   0.0013  1.0053   23     0.98(37)        -2.33/-1.31  I3        1.0007   0.0013  1.0053   26     0.98(20)        -2.77/-1.72  I5WI4     0.9998  -0.0057  1.0041   26     1.31(41)        -1.83/-0.88  I7N       0.9998  -0.0057  1.0043   23     1.71(6)         -1.66/-0.69  I7N       0.9998  -0.0057  1.0043   26     1.88(55)        -1.74/-0.78  I7N       0.9998  -0.0057  1.0043   27     0.88(8)         -2.91/-1.95  I1        0.9998  -0.0057  1.0038   27     1.10(64)        -2.82/-1.45  I10       0.9998  -0.0057  1.0037   27     0.72(32)        -0.58/-0.58  I2        0.9998  -0.0057  1.0040   27     1.11(27)        -0.57/-0.77  Mean                       1.0045          1.17(470)       -1.68/-0.91  S.D.(±)                    0.0008          0.35             0.92/ 0.58  System II  1I8SI9S   0.9996  -0.0025  1.0041   23     1.18(104)       -0.89/-0.89  I9N       0.9996  -0.0025  1.0039   23     0.90(70)        -1.83/-1.57  I8NI5E    0.9996  -0.0025  1.0041   23     1.14(59)        -1.73/-0.35  I3        0.9996  -0.0025  1.0045   23     0.85(35)        -2.14/-0.62  I3        0.9996  -0.0025  1.0045   26     0.69(13)        -2.44/-1.11   I5WI4     0.9998   0.0045  1.0050   26     0.79(41)        -2.14/-1.28  I7N       0.9998   0.0045  1.0051   23     0.88(5 )        -3.25/-1.47  I7N       0.9998   0.0045  1.0051   26     0.84(54)        -2.09/-0.32  I7N       0.9998   0.0045  1.0051   27     0.77(10)        -2.88/-1.10  I1        0.9998   0.0045  1.0041   27     1.11(70)        -3.51/-1.38   I10       0.9998   0.0045  1.0038   27     0.65(28)        -0.66/-0.66  I2        0.9998   0.0045  1.0035   27     1.11(24)        -1.38/-1.39  Mean                       1.0042          0.91(513)       -2.08/-1.01  S.D.(±)                    0.0005          0.18             0.87/ 0.44 _____________________________________________________________________________ For each CRM batch analyze d, precision is given as the standard deviation of  the mean of (n) analyses.

CRM ANALYSES AND SYSTEM ACCURACYIn addition to the leg-specific pipette volumes, Fig. 4a (system I) and Fig. 4b (system II) show the mean analytical differences (analyzed TCO2-certified TCO2) and the mean gas calibration factors for each survey leg. The plots are scaled so that each Y-axis spans a similar range in order that the factors controlling system accuracy can be more readily identified. These data are also tabulated and summarized in Table 3. Table 3 shows that the gravimetric volume determinations (Table 2) have detected real changes in V(cal) during the survey. The mean analytical differences calculated with the corrected pipette volumes (corr-vp, Table 3) are -0.91 and -1.01 µmol/kg for systems I and II, respectively. If the pipette volumes determined at the beginning of the survey (const-vp) were used, the corresponding differences would be -1.61 and -2.08 µmol/kg, showing that the routine determination of pipette volume increased accuracy by a factor of ~2.Fig. 5 is a bar chart of the mean analytical difference (accuracy) for systems I and II as a function of cell carbon age. Both systems behave very similarly with the best precision and accuracy early in the cell lifetime (<10 mg C), increasing differences for cells of intermediate ages (>10 to <30 mg C), and smaller differences for carbon ages exceeding 30 mg C which are not significantly different from those at ages <10 mg C. No corrections based on the analyzed-certified TCO2 differences or cell age have been applied to the CDIAC data set.Fig. 5.

SYSTEM REPEATABILITY AND PRECISION DURING THE SURVEYFor the survey as a whole, the operating conditions and analytical performance of the two SOMMA systems were virtually identical. Survey-wide the mean gas calibration factors of the two systems were nearly identical (1.0045 for system I compared to 1.0042 for II). While both systems yielded slightly negative (~1.0 µmol/kg) mean analytical differences (Table 3), the standard deviation of the analytical differences was slightly better on system II (±0.91 µmol/kg) than system I (1.17 µmol/kg). This is consistent with the gravimetric volume determinations where system II also exhibited a slightly higher precision (sp^2=±0.0036 cm^3 vs. ±0.0049 cm^3 for system I).For the CRM analyses, the precision or pooled standard deviation (sp^2) calculated according to Youden (1951) is 1.19 µmol/kg (df=977). For this calculation, the three batches of CRM analyzed on the two systems are treated as six separate samples with multiple replicates. Because sp^2 includes CRM data measured on both systems on all legs, it applies to both systems on all legs. For water samples, sp^2 was calculated from duplicates analyzed on each system during leg I8SI9S at the start of the survey and leg I5WI4 about half way through the survey. The sp^2 for leg I8SI9S is ±1.26 µmol/kg (df=15), and for leg I5WI4, sp^2 is ±0.91 µmol/kg (df=21). These values are consistent with the precision of the CRM analyses given in Table 3. For the survey, the overall precision of the TCO2 determination is ±1.19 µmol/kg.Fig. 6 is a plot of the analytical differences by system and CRM batch for the entire survey. The differences, calculated using the parameters in Table 3, reiterate the point that there are no significant analytical differences (bias) between systems or between CRM batches.Fig. 6.

The beginning and end of each leg is          marked by vertical dashed lines. The respective salinities and          certified TCO2 (µmol/kg) for batches 23, 26, and 27 are 33.483 and          1993.10, 33.258 and 1978.34, 33.209 and 1988.10 µmol/kg.4. DISCUSSIONThe Indian Ocean CO2 Survey differed from the previous DOE CO2 Survey efforts in that a single ship was used for all legs, and that the measurement groups shared the same analytical equipment. The latter included the use of a single cache of coulometric reagents (two different lot numbers both of which were tested pre-cruise with CRM), invariant sources of analytical gases, use of the same titration cell assemblies, standard sampling procedures, and standardized software. There was a pre-cruise training session, and all of the participants had prior experience with the sampling and measurement techniques (poisoning, reagent concentrations, standard calculations, glassware calibration, etc.) documented in the DOE Handbook of Methods (DOE, 1994). Thus, an extraordinary effort over several years to ensure analytical quality and uniformity culminated in the procedures used during the Indian Ocean Survey.An improvement in system accuracy (Table 3) of approximately 1 part in 2000 shows that the effort to gravimetrically determine the pipette volumes on each leg was worthwhile. The volumes of both systems did decrease slightly but significantly with time. Possible explanations include pressure changes in the carrier gas source (system I) or fouling of the glass pipette walls causing altered surface tension or displacement of small amounts of liquid (system II). Because the samples were poisoned with HgCl(2), it is unlikely that biological fouling was a problem, but the high quantity of grease used to seal the CRM bottles makes it possible that some of this grease found its way into the pipettes. After cleaning, V(cal) for leg I10 remained unchanged compared to the preceding leg I1 on system I and increased slightly on system II, but for both systems it was significantly smaller than the V(cal) determined for the initial leg (I8SI9S). After cleaning, the mean analytical difference for leg I10 (system I and II, n=2) was -0.62 µmol/kg compared to -0.40 µmol/kg on the initial leg I8S when the instruments were fresh from the laboratory indicating that pipettes were most accurate after cleaning. Whatever the cause of subsequent volume changes, the data confirm the importance of periodically redetermining the volume, and indicate that the procedure is mandatory for the highest accuracy over extended periods of analytical work and/or after major changes in system plumbing. In aggregate, both systems share a small negative analytical difference (-1.0 µmol/kg) for the CRM analyses throughout the survey even after pipette volume corrections have been applied.The cell accuracy vs. carbon age relationship shown in Fig. 5 is typical of data from previous cruises (K.M. Johnson, unpublished data). The best precision and accuracy is found at a carbon age of 5-10 mg C, a slightly reduced accuracy (usually as lower recoveries of CRM carbon) is observed between 10-30 mg C, gradually increasing recoveries and imprecision after 30 mg C until cell death where cell death is defined as a positive difference ≥3.0 µmol/kg. This behavior underlies the recommendation that cell lifetimes be limited to a carbon age of ≤35 mg C, i.e., to limit imprecision and because cell death normally occurs at carbon ages ≥35 mg C. During the survey, neither CRM or samples were run until the carbon age exceeded 5 mg C. This was accomplished by configuring the software to automatically run a test sample and three consecutive gas calibrations before samples were analyzed. The reasons for the observed cell behavior are not understood, but limiting cell lifetimes from ≥5 to ≤35 mg C probably helps to limit system drift which might compromise the sample analyses. Although the imprecision associated with cell aging is small and cell failure is rare at carbon ages ≤35 mg C, good analytical practice requires that samples should be run in random order rather than systematically in order of depth to avoid systematic biases which might result from any drift associated with cell age.Fig. 4a and b shows no correlation between the gas calibration factors and the analytical differences after the CRM analyses were corrected for pipette volume changes (Table 3). These data do show that the overall mean gas calibration factor for both systems is nearly the same (1.004), but that the temporal record with respect to gas calibration factor variation is not. Calibration factor variation (R.S.D.=0.06-0.08%) is greater than the variation in V(cal) (R.S.D.=0.03%), and is therefore a potentially more important control on system accuracy. For system I, the highest mean gas calibration factor (poorest recovery of CO2) was observed on leg I8N, while for system II, the corresponding result occurred months later, on leg I7N (same measurement group, see Table 1). Because the system calibration factors are not correlated with the analytical differences, the observed variations in calibration factors are real, i.e., they document a change in system response shared by the calibration and sample analyses rather than an isolated malfunction of the gas calibration hardware (see Fig. 2).The reason for gas calibration factor variation is not known. It could conceivably be due to procedures unique to each measurement group, e.g., positioning of the cathode electrode and the gas inlet tube with respect to the coulometer light source and photodetector (Fig. 3), plumbing differences resulting in leaks and small losses of CO2, or the amount of reagents used to dry the gas stream (Fig. 2). These procedural differences would affect sample determinations and gas calibration results similarly because, as Fig. 2 shows, the calibration gas follows the same route to the coulometer as the CO2 extracted from samples. Table 3 suggests at least one other possible cause of gas calibration factor variation. The coulometers were electronically calibrated by the BNL group at the start of the survey (I8SI9S) and about half way through the survey on leg I5WI4. Between legs I8SI9S and I5WI4 the coulometer calibration appears to have changed by 0.08% for system I, and by 0.02% for system II. These calibrations were separated by many weeks so the exact magnitude or timing of the shift is not known. Changes in the coulometer's circuitry affecting the electronic slope (Slope(ec)) and intercept (Int(ec)) would alter the gas calibration factor but would not affect system accuracy because, until recalibration, the previous electronic calibration coefficients represent constants in Eq. 1. In both systems, the sense of the apparent change in electronic calibration coefficients compared to the earlier coefficients is qualitatively consistent with the observed short-lived variation in gas calibration factors, and it is possible that this variation was due to unexplained changes in the coulometer response.The important point is the efficacy of the gas calibration procedure: corrections to data based solely on the CRM analyses which would usually be applied on a cruise-average basis may mask short term variation or step changes in system response arising from stochastic or procedural changes. The gas calibration procedure, in which known masses of pure CO2 are regularly analyzed, is an independent check of all system components except pipette volume, and it provides traceable documentation for the subsequent survey results.The importance of cell assembly selection should be stressed. Investigators have found that the behavior of individual cell assemblies can vary significantly (e.g., D. Chipman, personal communication, July 1996). The factors affecting cell performance are still not yet completely understood. Hence, the use of empirical selection criteria such as those given in Section 2 is recommended. It is beyond the scope of the paper to go into detail, but point 'a' in Fig. 3 illustrates one of the locations for potential problems. A faulty seal where the platinum electrode emerges from the glass insulator could allow infiltration and trapping of the cell solution in the insulator where electrochemical or chemical reactions could take place. Small quantities of this solution (at a pH different from the bulk cell solution) could randomly exchange with the bulk cell solution and cause titration errors. This would be difficult to detect. Assemblies which did not meet the empirical performance criteria in Section 2 were simply not used. The attention to cell assembly testing and selection is believed to a major reason for the success of the Indian Ocean TCO2 Survey. The survey assemblies were also carefully washed and dried. Drying at 55±5°C removes traces of the volatile and reactive cell solution from the rubber caps.TABLE 4: Results of the crossover analysis (see text for details)__________________________________________________________________ Crossover  Expedition legs       Stations        TCO2 difference no.

CROSSOVER ANALYSISThe agreement between TCO2 measurements made at similar locations, but on different legs of the survey, were used as a check on the internal consistency of the measurements. Deep measurements were used because of the lower variabil-ity in TCO2 observed in the deep ocean. Because most motion in the ocean interior takes place along surfaces of constant density (isopycnals), comparisons were made along isopycnal surfaces rather than depth.Our crossover analysis was performed as follows:(1) Locations at which different cruise legs intersected were identified as     'crossover points.' These are identified in Table 4 and are plotted on Fig. 1.(2) Stations located in the immediate proximity of these crossover points, for     which TCO2 data existed, were selected for the comparison. In general,     stations located within 100 km of the crossover location were selected.(3) For water samples collected below 2500 m, smooth curves were fit through the     TCO2 data as a function of the density anomaly referenced to 3000 dbar     (sigma 3) using Cleveland's LOESS smoother (Cleveland and Devlin, 1988). A     separate fit was performed to the data collected from each of the two     intersecting legs. The tension parameter for the smoother was adjusted     subjectively to give a 'reasonable' fit to the data at the majority of the     crossover locations, and the same value for the tension parameter was used     for all of the crossovers. Hence, while the fits to the data may not     necessarily represent the best possible at each individual crossover point,     the smoothing function has been consistently applied to all crossovers.(4) For each crossover, the difference between the two smooth curves was     evaluated at 50 evenly spaced intervals which covered the density range over     which the two data sets overlapped. A mean and a standard deviation of the     difference between the two curves was estimated based on these 50 values,     and these values are reported in Table 4. An illustration of a typical     analysis, the fitted data for crossover 4, is plotted on Fig. 7.Fig. 7.  An example of a crossover analysis using the TCO2 vs. density fits at          crossover location #4. This location was first sampled on leg I7N in          July 1995. It was resampled during January 1996 on leg I2. The TCO2          data from stations within 100 km of the crossover location and          depths>2500 m have been plotted vs. the potential density anomaly          referenced to 3000 dbar (sigma 3). The solid curves represent fits to          the data using a LOESS smoother (see text). The difference between the          fits for the two separate legs was evaluated at 50 density intervals          spaced evenly within the overlapping density range of the two legs (see          Table 4). The legend shows the station numbers used for the comparison.The results of the crossover analysis indicate that absolute leg-to-leg differences are always <3.0 µmol/kg (Table 4). Note that the comparisons were evaluated consistently such that the fit to data from the earlier leg at each crossover was subtracted from the fit to the later leg's data. Any uncorrected, long-term, monotonic drift in the calibration of the SOMMA analyzers over the course of the Indian Ocean expedition would therefore result in a non-zero value for the overall mean of these differences. The overall mean and standard deviation of the differences at crossovers 1-12 is -0.78 (±1.74) µmol/kg, and there was also no significant correlation between the individual differences derived from each crossover and the number of days which separated the crossover samplings. In general, the results of the crossover analysis are quite consistent with the overall precision (±1.2 µmol/kg) of the CRM analyses (see Section 3.3), and confirms that this precision applies to both systems throughout the survey. There is no suggestion in the crossover results of any additional significant sources of error or uncertainty.6. CONCLUSIONSIn summary, personnel aboard the R/V Knorr have been able to use the SOMMA-coulometer system to consistently replicate within analytical error the certified CRM TCO2 values. They have been able to use these systems to make, counting duplicates and CRM, over 20,000 determinations of TCO2 during the 14 months of the Indian Ocean Survey without significant instrument down time. The measurement groups have accomplished the following.(1) They have charted the history of the to-deliver volume of the sample     pipettes by gravimetric determinations, and corrected the water sample data     for the documented changes in the pipette volumes. The change in system     response due to the change in pipette volume corresponded to approximately 1     part in 2000 for TCO2 on both systems over the 10 months prior to recleaning     of the pipettes.(2) The groups have determined that the survey precision for the TCO2 analyses,     irrespective of which leg or system the water samples were analyzed on, was     ±1.2 µmol/kg. The precision of the two instruments was nearly identical and     consistent throughout the 14 months of the survey.(3) They have analyzed nearly 1000 CRM with an overall difference between the     analyzed and certified TCO2 of -1.0 µmol/kg (0.05%) on both systems which     demonstrates the equivalency of the two independent instruments, and meets     the survey's goal for accuracy.(4) The measurement groups have documented the influence of factors besides     pipette volume which could have affected accuracy including electronic     calibration, gas calibration, cell age, and cell assembly selection.For precision, the pooled standard deviation (sp^2=1.2 µmol/kg), calculated according to Youden (1951), is the most conservative estimate of precision because it includes all random analytical errors (sampling, instrumental, and method). The identical accuracy for the CRM analyses on both systems and the results of the crossover analysis (Table 4) indicate that the sp^2 statistic can be used to evaluate survey data sets irrespective of the leg or system the data originated from.The SOMMA-coulometry systems have allowed several scientific groups in a shared effort to examine carbon inventories and aquatic carbon cycling. For the Indian Ocean Survey, the sensitivity of the TCO2 determinations defined as the ratio of their precision (1.2 µmol/kg) over the TCO2 dynamic range (250 µmol/kg) was 0.4% which approaches the 0.1% sensitivity of the salinometers used, and these systems were as reliable as the salinometers. If their reliability is to be improved, the focus should be on understanding the basic behavior of the cell assemblies and the chemical behavior of the cell solutions as they age, so that procedural corrections can be made. The accuracy and precision of the Indian Ocean TCO2 analyses indicates that these data will be more than adequate for testing applicable oceanographic models, and allow the direct measurement of the CO2 uptake if and when these lines are resampled.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe would like to thank the US Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research for their support.

Two titration systems were used throughout this study to determine the pH, total alkalinity (TA) and total inorganic carbon dioxide (TCO2) of the samples collected during these cruises. The performance of these systems was monitored by making closed cell titration measurements on Certified Reference Materials (CRMs). A total of 962 titrations were made on six batches of CRMs during the cruises. The reproducibility calculated from these titrations was ±0.007 in pH, ±4.2 µmol/kg-1 in TA, and ±4.1 µmol/kg-1 in TCO2. The at-sea measurements on the CRMs were in reasonable agreement with laboratory measurements made on the same batches. These results demonstrate that the CRMs can be used as a reference standard for TA and to monitor the performance of titration systems at sea. Measurements made on the various legs of the cruise agreed to within 6 µmol/kg-1 at the 15 crossover points. The overall mean and standard deviation of the differences at all the crossovers are 2.1±2.1 µmol/kg-1. These crossover results are quite consistent with the overall reproducibility of the CRM analyses for TA (±4 µmol/kg-1) over the duration of the entire survey. The TA results for the Indian Ocean cruises provide a reliable data set that when combined with TCO2 data can completely characterize the carbonate system.Author Keywords: alkalinity; WOCE Hydrographic Program; CO2Index Terms:     reproductive toxicity; boron0304-4203r98r$ - see front matter q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

INTRODUCTIONFrom 1994 to 1996, a number of cruises were made in the Indian Ocean as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program to characterize the carbon dioxide system. This survey of CO2 was an integral part of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). The goals of this survey were to: (1) Quantify the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide by the oceans to better predict future atmospheric carbon dioxide levels; (2) Provide a global description of the carbon dioxide in the oceans to aid in the development of a 3-dimensional model of the oceanic carbon cycle; and (3) Characterize the transport of CO2 across the air-sea interface and the large scale transports of carbon dioxide within the oceans.To satisfy these goals, it was necessary to make very precise measurements of at least two of the carbonate system parameters (pH; total alkalinity, TA; total carbon dioxide, TCO2; and the fugacity of carbon dioxide, fCO2). Within the United States a large part of this survey was conducted by a team of investigators supported by the US Department of Energy. The team selected the measurement of TCO2 (Johnson et al., 1998) and of TA as the parameters to be measured in the water column and fCO2 in the atmosphere and surface waters. To insure that the measurements of TCO2 and TA were as precise and accurate as possible Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) (Dickson, 1990a) were used throughout the studies. The team also developed a set of Standard Operating Procedures1 (DOE, 1994) and, to a large extent, shared a common approach to the measurement program.For the studies in the Indian Ocean, the team shared equipment throughout the study. This paper presents the results of this team effort to precisely and accurately determine the total alkalinity during these cruises and the intercomparison between cruises. A companion paper (Johnson et al., 1998) describes the total carbon dioxide measurements.(1) DOE, 1991.

METHODSThe total alkalinity was determined on the JGOFS Indian Ocean cruises by the DOE group using systems described in detail by Millero et al. (1993). The total alkalinity of seawater was evaluated from the proton balance at the alkalinity equivalence point, pHequiv4.5, according to the exact definition mmmmof total alkalinity (Dickson, 1981)                     TA = [HCO¯(3)]+2[CO(3)(^2¯)]+[B(OH)¯(4)]                         +[OH¯]+[HPO^2¯(4)]+2[PO^3¯(4)]                          +[SiO(OH)¯(3)]+[HS¯]+[NH(3)]                        -[H+]-[HSO¯(4)]-[HF]-[H(3)PO(4)]                   (1)At any point in the titration, the total alkalinity of seawater can be calculated from the equation                  (W(0) x TA-W x C(HCl))/(W(0)+W) = [HCO¯(3)]                         +2[CO^2¯(3)]+[B(OH)¯(4)]+[OH¯]                      +[HPO^2¯(4)]+2PO^3¯(4)]+SiO(OH)¯(3)]                               +[HS¯]+[NH(3)]-[H+]                           -[HSO¯(4)]-[HF]-[H(3)PO(4)]                     (2)where W0 is the mass of the sample to be titrated, CHCl is the concentration of acid titrant, and W is the mass of acid added. In the calculations, volumes of the sample and of the acid were converted to mass using the density of seawater (Millero and Poisson, 1981) and the density of HCl in NaCl (Millero et al., 1977). Direct measurements made on the density of the acid used agreed to within 10 ppm with the equations used in the computer code. At the endpoint (W2) the total alkalinity is given by                              TA = W2 x C(HCl)/W(0)                        (3)The uncertainties in TA associated with acid concentration (0.25±0.0001 M), mass of acid delivered (2.5±0.0005 g), and mass of the sample (200±0.05 g) are ±1, ±0.5, and ±0.5 µmol/kg-1, respectively (which gives a probable error of about ±1 µmol/kg-1). By using the same acid, titrators, and acid throughout a given cruise one can obtain a precision that is comparable with this probable error. Discussed below are more details on the components of the titration systems.2.1. TITRATION SYSTEMThe titration systems used to determine TA consist of a Metrohm 665 Dosimat titrator and an Orion 720A pH meter controlled by a personal computer (Millero et al., 1993). Both the acid titrant in a water-jacketed burette and the seawater sample in a water-jacketed cell were controlled to a constant temperature of 25±0.1°C with a Neslab constant temperature bath. The plexiglass water-jacketed cells used for our studies were similar to that used by Bradshaw and Brewer (1988) except a larger volume (about 200 cm3) was used to improve the precision. These cells have fill and drain valves that increased the reproducibility of the cell volume.A Lab Windows C program is used to run the titration and record the volume of the added acid and the emf of the electrodes using RS232 interfaces. The titration is made by adding HCl to seawater past the alkalinity end point. A typical titration records the average of ten emf readings after they become stable (±0.09 mV) and adds enough acid to change the voltage by a pre-assigned increment (13 mV). In contrast to the delivery of a fixed volume of acid, this method gives more data points in the range of a rapid increase in the emf near the endpoint. A full titration (25 points) takes about 20 min.2.1.1. ELECTRODESThe electrodes used to measure the emf of the sample during a titration consist of a ROSS glass pH electrode and an Orion double junction Ag, AgCl reference electrode. A number of electrodes were screened to select those to be used in the titrators. Electrodes with non-Nernstian behavior (slopes more than 1.0 mV different from the theoretical value) were discarded. The reliability of the electrodes was evaluated by determining the TA, TCO2 and pH of Gulf Stream seawater. The titration values of TCO2 are normally higher than the values measured by coulometry and the values of pH are typically lower than the values obtained by spectrophotometric methods. These differences in TCO2 and pH are caused by the non-Nernstian behavior of the electrodes (Millero et al., 1993). We selected electrodes which gave values of TCO2 and pH close to the values determined by coulometric and by spectrophotometric methods, respectively.2.1.2. STANDARD ACIDSThe HCl used for this study and for all of our cruises was made in the laboratory, standardized, and stored in 500 cm3 glass bottles. The 0.25 M HCl solutions were made from 1 M Mallinckrodt standard solutions in 0.45 M NaCl to yield an ionic strength equivalent to that of average seawater (0.7 M). The concentration of HCl was measured using a constant current coulometric technique (Taylor and Smith, 1959; Marinenko and Taylor, 1968). Coulometric analysis of the acids used for these cruises agreed to ±0.0001 M with the analyses performed independently on the same batches of acids in Dr. A. Dickson's laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The mutual consistency of these acids was also confirmed by comparing the values of TA measured on Gulf Stream seawater using different batches of acids, but using the same titrator and electrodes. The uncertainties in TA associated with acid concentration (±0.0001 M) is 1 µmol/kg-1.2.1.3. VOLUME OF THE CELLSThe volume of each of the titration cells used at sea was determined by comparing the values of TA obtained for Gulf Stream seawater with open and closed cells in the laboratory. All of the open cell laboratory TA measurements were made with weighed amounts of seawater in a cell with a small head-space. If the volume is correct, the TA from the open and closed cells should be the same, provided that the same acid, titrator, and electrodes are used. At least 10 measurements were made on each cell yielding an average TA that agreed with the assigned value to better than 1 µmol/kg-1. If the volume of a titration cell needed to be adjusted during the cruise (because of broken electrodes, plungers etc.), the volumes were determined from the daily titrations on low-nutrient surface seawater (usually collected before the first station) and Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) provided by Dr. A. Dickson (SIO). Post-cruise calibrations of the cells were made by comparing the values of TA for the Gulf Stream seawater and CRM with open and closed cells. The nominal volumes of all the cells were about 200 cm3, and the values were determined to ±0.05 cm3. The uncertainty in TA associated with this uncertainty in the volume of the cells (±0.05 cm3) is 0.5 µmol/kg-1 obtained for the weighed samples.2.1.4. VOLUME OF TITRANTThe volume of HCl delivered to the cell is traditionally assumed to have small uncertainty (Dickson, 1981) and equated to the digital output of the titrator. Calibrations of all the burettes of the Dosimats used were made with Milli-Q water at 25°C. Since the cell volumes are calibrated using standard solutions, errors in the accuracy of volume delivery will be partially canceled and included in the value of cell volumes assigned. The calibration of all the Dosimats used at sea and in the laboratory indicated that the amount of acid delivered (for a typical calculation) was uncertain to ±0.0005 cm3. This uncertainty in the volume delivered leads to an error in the TA of ±0.5 µmol/kg-1. Nevertheless, corrections to the Dosimat reading were made in all of our laboratory TA measurements and calibrations to insure that the assigned value for a different batch of CRM and Gulf Stream water was not affected by the use of different Dosimats. These corrections were also made when calculating the volume of each cell.2.2. EVALUATION OF THE CARBONATE PARAMETERSA FORTRAN computer program has been developed to calculate the carbonate parameters (pH, E*, TA, TCO2, and pK(1)) in the seawater solutions. The program is patterned after those developed by Dickson (1981), Johansson and Wedborg (1982) and Dickson (1; DOE, 1994). The fitting is performed using the STEPIT routine (J.P. Chandler, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74074). The STEPIT software package minimizes the sum of squares of residuals by adjusting the parameters E*, TA, TCO2 and pK(1) of carbonic acid. The computer program is based on Eq. 2 and assumes that nutrients such as phosphate, silicate and ammonia are negligible. This assumption is strictly valid only for surface waters. Neglecting the concentration of nutrients in the seawater sample does not affect the accuracy of TA, but must be considered when calculating the carbonate alkalinity (CA=[HCO¯(3)]+2 [CO^2¯(3)]) from TA.The pH and pK of the acids used in the program are on the seawater scale, [H+]sw[H+]+[HSO¯(4)]+[HF] (Dickson, 1984). The dissociation constants used in the program were taken from Dickson and Millero (1987) for carbonic acid, from Dickson (1990b) for boric acid, from Dickson and Riley (1979) for HF, from Dickson (1990c) for HSO¯(4) and from Millero (1995) for water. The program requires as inputs the concentration of acid, volume of the cell, salinity, temperature, measured emfs (E) and volumes of HCl (V). To obtain a reliable TA from a full titration, at least 25 data points should be collected (9 data points between pH 3.0 to 4.5). The precision of the fit is less than 0.4 µmol/ kg_1 when pK(1) is allowed to vary and 1.5 µmol/kg-1 when pK(1) is fixed. Our titration program has been compared to the titration programs used by others (Johansson and Wedborg, 1982; Bradshaw and Brewer, 1988) and the values of TA agree to within ±1 µmol/kg-1.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION3.1. LABORATORY TA MEASUREMENTS OF CRMSThe laboratory TA measurements made on the CRMs used throughout this study are summarized in Table 1. The results obtained by both laboratories demonstrate that no systematic differences in TA are found. With the exception of Batch 29, the differences in the measurements of the CRMs between the two laboratories are less that 2 µmol/kg-1. Since the Miami measurements were made with the same acid as used at sea, one cannot attribute the differences in Batch 29 to differences in the concentration of the acids (calibrated at SIO). The Miami measurements were also made using the same acid for all the batches of CRM within a one-week period to ensure the internal consistency of its results. The measurements made on the acid concentration in Miami and SIO by a coulometric titration were in agreement to ±0.0001 M, which is equivalent to an error of ±1 µmol/kg-1 in TA.TABLE 1: Comparison of the total alkalinity of Certified Reference Materials          _______________________________________________________________                   Batch   SIO    Miami   ∆(S-M)  Cruise           -----  ------  ------  ------  ------------------------------            23   2212.7  2213.7   -1.0   I8S/I9S, I9N, I8N/I5E, I3, I7N             24   2215.5  2215.8   -0.3   I8R                26   2176.6  2175.1    1.5   I3, I5W/I4, I-7N             27   2214.9  2214.3    0.6   I7N, I1, I10, I2             29   2184.8  2182.3    2.5   I8R                30   2201.9  2200.5    1.4   I2         _______________________________________________________________3.2. AT SEA MEASUREMENTS OF TA, TCO2, AND PH ON CRMS3.2.1. Accuracy of at sea measurementsThe tracts of the cruise made during the Indian Ocean studies are shown in Fig. 1. A total of 962 titrations were made on six batches of the CRMs during the cruises (Table 2). A summary of the pH, TA and TCO2 measurements made on CRMs (Table 3) throughout the cruise is shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The reproducibility on the six batches of the CRMs used was ±0.007 in pH, ±4.2 µmol/kg-1 in TA, and ±4.1 µmol/kg-1 in TCO2. The at sea TA measurements on the CRMs were in good agreement (2-4 µmol/kg-1) with laboratory measurements made on the same batches at MIAMI and SIO. These small differences (2-4 µmol/kg-1) are well within the overall precision of our measurements and can be attributed to uncertainties in the volume of cells assigned in the laboratory before the cruises. However, the cells used on I7 gave significantly greater errors than the values obtained in the laboratories on the same batch of CRM. These large discrepancies might be attributed to inaccurately assigned volumes of the cells after they were repaired for leakage due to repositioning of a reference electrode after changing the inner filling solution.Fig. 1.

Long term stability of a cell performanceThe at sea TA measurements on the CRMs can be used to examine the long-term stability of the cells used during the cruises. Overall, the TA results obtained using cells for a given cruise did not show any systematic trends. Differences in TA between laboratory and field measurements remained unchanged over the entire period of each cruise. However, inter-cruise variations in TA between laboratory and field results were observed when the same cells were used. For instance, cells 2 and 13 were used for four consecutive cruises over the period of six months. When these two cells were used on the first cruise (I3), the field measurements agreed to within ±2 µmol/kg-1 with the values obtained in the laboratory. These small discrepancies are within the precision of our measurements. When the same cells were used for the later cruises, the differences in TA between laboratory and field measurements became significantly larger (9 µmol/kg-1). As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, these larger differences can be attributed to changes in the assigned volume of the cells due to repositioning of a reference electrode. These inter-cruise variations in TA can be corrected by normalizing the measured values obtained during the cruises using the corrections required to reproduce the values assigned for the CRMs by SIO (Table 4). This correction was applied using                             ∆ = TA(meas,CRM)-CRM)                         (4)                     TA(corr.) = TA(meas.) x [CRM/(CRM+∆)]                 (5)where CRM is the SIO-certified values.TABLE 4: Differences between TA measurements made at sea and values measured          in the laboratory (SIO)______________________________________________________________________________ Cell  I8S/I9S  I9N  I8N/I5E   I3     I5W/I4   I7N    I1   I8R   I10    I2  ----  -------  ---  -------  ------  ------  ------  ---  ---  ----  -------   2                         +2.6(a)   +6.7  +9.9(a) +5.2     4                                                       0.7    5    +10.6  +2.3   +0.3      6    +8.1   +4.8   -2.6      7                                                 +4.7    11                                                            -2.6  +4.8(a)   13                         +2.1(a)   +6.0  +4.9(a) +1.3    14                                                 +3.0    16                                                            -1.4  +3.7(a)   17                                                      -0.9   18                                                      -1.4   20    +7.3   +1.5   ______________________________________________________________________________(a)Based on the weighted average on different CRM. 3.3. CROSSOVER ANALYSISIn order to cross-check our estimates of accuracy of the TA data, which are derived from analyses of CRMs, we examined the agreement between TA measurements made at identical locations on different legs of the Indian Ocean expedition. All of these comparisons have been made after applying the corrections given in Table 4. The implicit assumption is that temporal and spatial gradients of TA concentrations in the deep ocean are small relative to measurement accuracy, so that water sampled at the same location in the deep ocean at two different times should have near-identical values of TA. In practice, vertical gradients of TA can be significant relative to measurement accuracy and there can also be significant vertical motions in the deep ocean. Hence, measurements made at the same geographical location cannot be compared simply on the basis of their common depth. Because most motion in the ocean interior takes place along surfaces of constant density (isopycnals), it is preferable to compare concentrations using density as the frame of reference rather than depth.TABLE 5: Crossover results for the TA measurements made in the Indian Ocean          _________________________________________________                   Number  Stations      Legs               ∆TA              ------  ------------  ---------------  --------            1     927,929,931,  I1-I7N            1.7±1.0                      780,782,784                2     987,990,266,  I1-I9N           -2.1±5.9                      268,270                3     996,998,      I1-I9Nb           1.2±0.8                      233,235                4     1205,728,     I2-I7N            5.6±2.4                      730                5     1137,1139,    I2-I9N/I5E        3.4±2.2                      320,324                6     1094,1096,    I2-I9N           -3.4±1.4                      191,193                7     1078,1075     I2-I10            1.8±2.4                8     705,547,549   I5W/I4-I3         0.7±1.7                9     498,499,501,  I3-I8N/I5E       -0.8±2.3                      346,348               10     472,169       I3-I9N           -0.8±0.6               11     1039,452,454  I10-I3           -1.0±0.7               12     404,406,408,  I8N/I5E-I8S/I9S  -2.7±3.8                      9,11,13               13     861,808       I1-I7N            0.3±0.6               14     709,707       I7N-I5W/I4        2.4±1.7               15     966,968,969,  I1-I8N/I5E       -4.2±4.5                      283,287         _________________________________________________Our crossover analyses were performed as follows.(1) Locations at which different cruise legs intersected were identified as     crossover points. These are identified in Table 5 and Fig. 1.(2) Stations located in the immediate proximity of these crossover points,     for which TA data existed, were selected for the comparison. In general,     stations located within 100 km of the crossover location were selected.(3) For water samples collected below 2500 m, smooth curves were fit through     the TA data as a function of the density anomaly referenced to 3000 db     (sigma-3) using Cleveland's loess or smoother local regression (Cleveland     and Devlin, 1988; Cleveland and Grosse, 1991; Chambers and Hastie, 1991). A     separate fit was performed to the data collected from each of the two     intersecting legs. The tension parameter for the smoother was adjusted     subjectively to give a 'reasonable' fit to the data at the majority of the     crossover locations, and the same value for the tension parameter was used     for all of the crossovers. Hence, while the fits to the data may not     necessarily represent the best possible at each individual crossover point,     the smoothing function has been applied consistently. It is important to     note that the comparison of the data at the crossover points does not depend     on the fitting algorithm within the experimental error.(4) For each crossover, the difference between the two smooth curves was     evaluated at 50 evenly spaced intervals that covered the density range over     which the two data sets overlapped. A mean and a standard deviation of the     difference between the two curves was estimated based on these 50 values,     and these values are reported in Table 5 and shown in Fig. 5. An example of     the crossover for cruises I3-I5W/I4 is shown in Fig. 6.Fig. 5.  Summary of the TA reproducibility for crossover points in the Indian          Ocean.Fig. 6.  Results for a typical crossover comparison (I3-I5W/I4) in the Indian          Ocean.The results of the crossover analysis indicate that absolute leg-to-leg differences are always <6 µmol/kg-1. Note that the comparisons were evaluated consistently such that the fit to data from the earlier leg at each crossover was subtracted from the fit to the later leg's data. Any uncorrected, long-term, monotonic drift in the calibration of the titrators over the course of the Indian Ocean expedition would therefore tend to result in a non-zero value for the overall mean of these differences. The overall mean and standard deviation of the differences at all the crossovers are 2.1±2.1 µmol kg_1. In general, the results of the crossover analysis are quite consistent with the overall reproducibility of the CRM analyses (±4 µmol/kg-1) over the duration of the entire Survey.4. CONCLUSIONAt-sea total alkalinity measurements on the several CRM batches demonstrated that the measurements made by various investigators were precise to about ±4 µmol/kg-1. This level of the precision of at sea measurements was approximately two times worse than that in the laboratory. Differences in the precision between different investigators suggest that the performance of TA measurements was dependent upon the operators. The inter-cruise variations in total alkalinity between laboratory and field results clearly demonstrate that CRMs are an essential component to monitor the performance of titration systems and increase the accuracy for total alkalinity measurements in the field.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of the Department of Energy for their support of the CO2 studies.

These estimates employed slightly modified ∆C* and time series techniques originally proposed by Gruber et al. [1996] and Wallace [1995], respectively. Together, the two methods yield the total oceanic anthropogenic CO2 and the carbon increase over the past 2 decades. The highest concentrations and the deepest penetrations of anthropogenic carbon are associated with the Subtropical Convergence at around 30° to 40°S. With both techniques, the lowest anthropogenic CO2 column inventories are observed south of 50°S. The total anthropogenic CO2 inventory north of 35°S was 13.6±2 Pg C in 1995. The inventory increase since GEOSECS (Geochemical Ocean Sections Program) was 4.1±1 Pg C for the same area. Approximately 6.7±1 Pg C are stored in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, giving a total Indian Ocean inventory of 20.3 ±3 Pg C for 1995. These estimates are compared to anthropogenic CO2 inventories estimated by the Princeton ocean biogeochemistry model. The model predicts an Indian Ocean sink north of 35°S that is only 0.61-0.68 times the results presented here; while the Southern Ocean sink is nearly 2.6 times higher than the measurement-based estimate. These results clearly identify areas in the models that need further examination and provide a good baseline for future studies of the anthropogenic inventory.1.  INTRODUCTIONThe current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimate for the oceanic sink of anthropogenic CO2 (2.0 ±D.8 Pg C yr-I) is based primarily on ocean models [e.g., Sarmiento et al., 1992; Sarmiento and Sundquist, 1992; Siegenthaler and Sarmiento, 1993; Siegenthaler and Joos, 1992; Stocker et al., 1994], atmospheric models [e.g., Keeling et al., 1989; Keeling and Shertz, 1992] or on the oceanic distribution of related species such as δ13C [Quay et al., 1992]. Although the basic assumptions used in these methods are reasonably well grounded, there will always be room for doubt with indirect approaches. Direct estimates of the oceanic CO2 sink, however, have been primarily limited by a lack of high-quality data on a global scale.Two general approaches can be used to estimate the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans. One approach, initially proposed by Tans et al. [1990], is to use direct measurements of the air-sea difference in CO2 partial pressure together with global winds and a gas exchange coefficient to estimate the net transfer of CO2 into the oceans. These estimates, together with an atmospheric transport model, predicted that the oceanic sink was only 0.3 to 0.8 Pg C yr-', much smaller than the model predictions. The difficulty with the ∆C02 approach lies both in the large uncertainty in the wind speed dependence of the air-sea gas exchange velocity and in the ability to properly represent the large temporal and spatial variability of the surface ocean pC02 because of a lack of seasonal, global data coverage. This estimate has recently been revised to 0.6 to 1.34 Pg C yr-I with the addition of more data and a lateral advection-diffusion transport equation to help with the necessary temporal and spatial interpolations [Takahashi et al., 1997].A second approach, which avoids many of the problems of temporal variability, is to estimate the inventory of anthropogenic CO2 stored in the oceans interior based on inorganic carbon measurements. Again, the problem with this approach in the past has been a lack of high-quality global data coverage. As pointed out by Broecker et al. [1979] after completion of the last global oceanographic survey, GEOSECS (Geochemical Ocean Sections Program), the precision of ocean carbon measurements at that time was two orders of magnitude smaller than the predicted 0.035% annual increase in surface ocean dissolved inorganic carbon. Nearly 20 years have passed since GEOSECS, and the quality of today's carbon measurements has improved significantly.This is the first of several papers aimed at estimating the anthropogenic CO2 inventory of the oceans based on the recent global survey of CO2 in the oceans. The survey was conducted as part of the JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study) in close cooperation with the WOCE-HP (World Ocean Circulation Experiment - Hydrographic Programme). This program was a multiyear effort to collect high-precision inorganic carbon data with the highest possible spatial resolution on a global scale. This paper will focus on anthropogenic CO2 estimates for the Indian Ocean. Papers will soon follow with estimates for the other major ocean basins, with the ultimate goal of generating an estimate of the global oceanic anthropogenic CO2 sink based on direct carbon system measurements. The strength of these calculations lies not only in our ability to directly estimate the magnitude of the oceanic anthropogenic CO2 sink but also in the fact that these estimates can be directly compared to anthropogenic CO2 inventories estimated by carbon cycle ocean general circulation models (GCMs). The two methods described here provide information over different timescales. The combined results place strong constraints on the uptake rate for anthropogenic CO2 and are useful for identifying weaknesses in the models.2.  METHODSEstimates of the anthropogenic CO2 inventory are determined from measured values using two different techniques. The first technique, referred to as the "time series" approach, is based on quantifying the increase in total carbon dioxide (TC02) since GEOSECS. The second approach quantifies the total anthropogenic CO2 inventory using a quasi-conservative tracer, ∆C*. Although the general idea for both techniques has been around for a long time, recent improvements in the estimation of the preserved end-member concentrations together with significant Improvements in the accuracy and spatial coverage of global carbon data give us much more confidence in these results. Given the difficulty of isolating the anthropogenic signal from the large TC02 background, however, it is relevant to summarize the quality of the carbon data set and the techniques used to estimate the anthropogenic signal.2.1.  DATA QUALITYOver 20,000 water samples collected between December 1994 and July 1996 as part of the U.S. WOCE Indian Ocean survey were analyzed for both TC02 and total alkalinity (TA) using standard coulometric and potentiometric techniques, respectively. Figure 1 shows the locations of the 1352 stations occupied by U.S. WOCE as part of the Indian Ocean survey together with the station locations from the GEOSECS Indian Ocean Survey and the French INDIGO I, II, and III and CIVA-1 (WOCE designation I6S) Cruises Details of the WOCE/JGOFS Indian Ocean CO2 measurement program, including personnel, sampling procedures, measurement protocols and data quality assurance/quality control checks are described elsewhere [Johnson et al., 1998; Millero et al., 1998a]. Calibrations of both the TC02 and TA systems were checked approximately every 12 hours by analyzing Certified Reference Material (CRM) samples with known concentrations of TC02 and TA [Dickson, 1990] (A.G. Dickson, Oceanic carbon dioxide quality control at http://www-mpl.ucsd. edulpeople/adicksonlC02_QC/, 1998). On the basis of these CRM analyses the accuracy of the TC02 and TA measurements was estimated to be ±2 and ±4 µmol kg-1, respectively. Primary hydrographic data from the conductivity- temperature-depth/Rosette were collected and analyzed following standard procedures [Millard, 1982]. Samples were collected for salinity on every bottle and analyzed with an Autosal salinometer using standard techniques [UNESCO, 1981]. Oxygen samples were analyzed with an automated system using a modified Winkler technique [Culberson et al., 1991]. Nutrients were analyzed on a four-channel Technicon AutoAnalyzer II following the methods of Gordon et al. [1992]. Chlorofluorocarbon samples were analyzed on a gas chromatograph using the techniques of Bullister and Weiss [1988]. Complete details of the analytical protocols and personnel can be obtained from the individual cruise reports available through the WOCE Office. FIGURE 1:  Station locations for WOCE Indian Ocean (circles),            CIVA-1/I6S (crosses), INDIGO I (stars), INDIGO            II (inverted triangles), INDIGO III (triangles),            and GEOSECS (solid squares) Indian Ocean Surveys.            Numbered boxes indicate location of crossovers            discussed in the text. Map generated using Generic            Mapping Tools version 3 [Wessel and Smith, 1995].All of the data available at the time this manuscript was written have been included in the Indian Ocean analysis. For the primary hydrographic and nutrient data this means that the preliminary values available at the conclusion of the cruise were used. While we would prefer to use the final hydrographic data, typical post cruise corrections for the WOCE data sets are well below noise level for these calculations. Preliminary to semifinal chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) data were used to estimate the water age necessary for one of the correction terms in the ∆C* method. Although post cruise blank corrections can influence the final CFC concentrations, an examination of the existing data (except 18NI5E because data were not available at time of writing) indicated that the CFC-ll and CFC-12 age comparisons as well as comparisons of the data from one leg to the next were reasonably consistent with each other. The calculations were limited to waters with CFC-12 ages of less than 40 years where potential blank corrections are a relatively small fraction of the signal and mixing effects are minimized. The carbon data, which primarily influence the quality of the calculations, have all been calibrated and finalized as discussed briefly below.Examination of Figure 1 reveals that although the WOCE survey was extensive, a large data gap exists in the southwestern Indian Ocean. To fill in this gap, data from the three French survey legs INDIGO I (February-March 1985), IT (April 1986) and 1lI (January-February 1987) as well as the more recent French cruise CIVA-1 (February-March 1993 (WOCE designation 16S» were included in the analysis [Poisson et al., 1988; 1989; 1990]. TC02 and TA were analyzed on the INDIGO cruises using standard potentiometric titration techniques developed by Edmond [1970]. Potentiometric titrations were also used to analyze the TA samples on CIVA-1, but the TC02 samples were analyzed using the coulometric techniques of Johnson et al. [1985]. The internal consistency of these cruises was examined by comparing carbon values in the deep waters (pressure> 2500 dbars) at the intersections of different legs. The stations selected for each crossover were those with carbon values which were closest to the intersection point. Smooth curves were fit through the data from each cruise as a function of sigma- 3 (density anomaly referenced to 3000 dbars) using Cleveland's loess function [Cleveland and Devlin, 1988; Cleveland et al., 1992]. The difference between the curves was evaluated at 50 evenly spaced intervals that covered the density range over which the two data sets overlapped. The mean and standard deviation of the difference in TA and TC02 at the 35 intersections identified in Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2. The long-term stability of the WOCE/JGOFS measurements can be estimated from the first 17 crossover results. The mean of the absolute values for the leg-to-leg differences was less than the estimated accuracy for both TC02 (1.8 ±0.8 µmol kg-1) and TA (2.4 ±1.6 µmol kg-1). Although there is only one reliable crossover point between the WOCE/JGOFS cruises and the CIVA-1 (I6S) cruise, the differences for both parameters are within the estimated accuracy of the measurements. Results from the analysis of CRM samples on the CIVA-1 cruise also support the quality of the measurements. Some of the older INDIGO cruises, however, did appear to have offsets relative to the WOCE/JGOFS and CIVA-1 data. INDIGO I and IT alkalinity values averaged 6.5 µmol kg-1 high and 6.8 µmol kg-1 low, respectively, while the INDIGO 1lI alkalinity values showed no clear offset. The INDIGO TC02 values were all consistently high relative to WOCE/JGOFS and CIVA-1, with differences of 10.7,9.4, and 6.4 µmol kg-1, respectively. These offsets are consistent with differences observed between at-sea values and replicate samples run at C.D. Keeling's shore-based TC02 facility (P. Guenther, personal communication, 1998). Since the INDIGO cruises were run prior to the introduction of CRMs, these offsets were presumed to be calibration differences, and each leg was adjusted to bring the values in line with the remaining cruises. The dotted boxes in Figure 2 show the original offsets at the crossovers. The solid boxes show the final offsets used in the following calculations. The means of the absolute values for the leg-to-leg differences for all 35 crossover analyses suggest that the final data set is internally consistent to ± 2.2 and 3.0 µmol kg-1 for TC02 and TA, respectively.2.2.  "TIME SERIES" CALCULATIONSThe "time series" method for estimating the increase in the anthropogenic inventory uses measurements of TC02 made at a certain point in time to develop a predictive equation based on a multiple linear regression of the observed TC02 and simultaneously measured parameters such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, and TA (or silicate). These empirical multiparameter relationships have been shown to hold over large spatial scales, and their use drastically reduces the complicating effects of natural variability in determining temporal trends [Brewer et al., 1995; Wallace, 1995; Brewer et al., 1997]. The TC02 residuals from such predictive equations can be compared directly with patterns of residuals evaluated using the same predictive equation with TA, oxygen, and hydrographic data collected at different times (e.g., over decadal intervals). Since the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will increase the TC02 of the waters but will not directly affect the concentrations of the fit parameters, systematic changes in the magnitude and distribution of the TC02 residuals over time provide a direct estimate of the oceanic CO2 inventory change due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO2. The most comprehensive historical carbon data set for the Indian Ocean is from the GEOSECS expedition. By examining the WOCE data relative to that collected during the 1977-1978 GEOSECS Indian Ocean Survey, the increase in anthropogenic inventory over the last 18 years can be estimated.2.2.1.  GEOSECS FIT All of the GEOSECS data from the Indian Ocean (excluding Gulf of Aden and Red Sea regions) were fit with a single predictive equation as a function of potential temperature (9), salinity (S), apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and TA. To minimize the influence of short-term temporal variability, only data from pressures greater than 200 dbars were included in the fit. Despite the large area covered, the GEOSECS TC02 values can be predicted from this equation to ± 5.2 µmol kg-1 (~ =0.992 and N = 1120). There is, however, a pattern in the residuals that correlates with observed hydrographic regions in the Indian Ocean (Figure 3).In an attempt to improve the fit, a categorical variable based on region was added to the regression. The categorical variable differs from the other continuous variables by the fact that it is either applied or not applied depending on whether the sample is located within the region. The regions were defined as follows: I, Arabian Sea (north of l0°N and west of 78°E); 2, North of 10°S (excluding Arabian Sea); 3, Chemical Front (21°S to 10°S); 4, Central Gyre (35°S to 21°S); and 5, Southern Ocean (south of 35°S)The addition of the regional variable resulted in a marginal improvement in the fit (~ =0.993 and (J =4.9 µmol kg-1) but more importantly, removed the regional bias in the predictive equation. The coefficients of the final fit are shown in Figure 4 along with a plot of the measured versus calculated TC02 values for all of the points used in the fit. The resulting equation was then used to generate TC02 values for each of the WOCE sample locations based on the measured temperature, salinity, oxygen, and TA values. The difference between the measured TC02 and the predicted TC02 reflects the CO2 increase in the time between the two cruises. For this work the difference is referred to as "excess CO2,"FIGURE 2:  Mean difference between deep water values of (a) TA            and (b) TC02 for cruise intersections identified in            Figure 1. Bars indicate one standard deviation.

Solid boxes cover the range of ±1            standard deviation about the mean. White lines within            the boxes indicate median values. The whiskers indicate            the range of data within the 99% confidence interval.            The bars outside the whiskers give the values of            outliers in the data set.FIGURE 4:  Plot of measured GEOSECS TC02 versus the calculated            values.

The surface waters, however, are dominated by seasonal variability which can bias the residual calculations. The excess CO2 of the surface waters therefore was determined from the difference in the estimated annual mean TC02 concentrations between GEOSECS and WOCE. The annual mean TC02 concentration was calculated from TA and surface water ƒC02. The surface alkalinity was estimated from the gridded annual mean salinity and temperature values of Levitus et al. [1994] and Levitus and Boyer [1994] using a multiple linear fit of the WOCE/JGOFS surface (pressure < 60 dbars) TA data to the measured surface temperature and salinity. The 1978 and 1995 surface water jC02 concentrations were estimated from the annual mean atmospheric concentration for the 2 years. and the annual mean ∆pC02 values estimated from the full correction scheme of Takahashi et al. [1997]. The excess TC02 values between the surface and 200 dbars were estimated with a linear approximation between the surface and 200 dbars values for each 1° grid box.2.2.2. DATA CONSISTENCY. One of the major concerns with the time series technique is the necessity of having two data sets that are consistent with each other. This consistency can be well documented for both TC02 and TA today through the use of certified reference materials (CRMs) supplied by A. Dickson of Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO). Since CRMs were not available at the time of GEOSECS. the only way to infer consistency with the WOCE data set is to assume the deep water carbon distributions have not changed since GEOSECS. The most reliable way to compare the two data sets is to examine the difference between the predicted TC02 and the measured TC02 (excess CO2) in deep waters. The basic assumption with this technique is that the correlation between the different hydrographic parameters in the deep waters does not change with time. Given the long residence time of the deep and bottom waters in the ocean. this should be a reasonable assumption. This technique has the advantage that it implicitly accounts for the possibility of real variability in hydrographic properties between the two expeditions which would not be taken into account by simply comparing carbon profiles.Examination of the excess CO2 values in waters that should be free of anthropogenic CO2 (pressures> 2000 dbars and containing no detectable chlorofluorocarbons) revealed that the GEOSECS values were 22.5 ±3 µmol kg-1 higher than the comparable WOCE measurements. This difference is comparable to the correction of 18 ± 7 µmol kg-1 noted by Weiss et al. [1983] to make the TC02 measurements consistent with the TA and discrete CO2 partial pressure measurements based on the Merbach et al. [1973] dissociation constants. Additional support for an adjustment of the original GEOSECS data comes from C. D. Keeling's shore-based analysis ofTC02 samples collected on both the GEOSECS and the WOCE/JGOFS expeditions. Weiss et al. [1983] point out that the shore-based analyses of Keeling were systematically smaller than the at-sea measurements by 16.5 ± 5 µmol kg-1 during GEOSECS. Similar comparisons between the WOCE/JGOFS at-sea measurements with Keeling's shore-based analyses indicate that the shore based samples are approximately 5 µmol kg-1 higher than the at sea values (P. Guenther. personal communication. 1998). Together. the GEOSECS-Keeling-WOCE/JGOFS combination suggests an offset of 21.5 µmol kg-1 between GEOSECS and WOCE/JGOFS at-sea measurements. It is also important to note that there is no indication of a depth or concentration dependent correction for the GEOSECS data. The shore-based comparison. based only on samples collected at the surface. is within I µmol kg-1 of the deep comparison described above. On the basis of these results a constant correction of the -22.5 µmol kg-1 was applied to the GEOSECS TC02 values to improve the consistency of the two data sets.Ideally. the data used in the time series calculations would cover the same geographic region with as much of a time difference as possible. The trade-off. however. is that the quality and spatial coverage of the older data sets is generally very limited. Given the relatively small area of overlap between the WOCE/JGOFS and INDIGO data sets and the shorter time difference between cruises (9 years versus 18 years for WOCE - GEOSECS). the time series analysis was limited to a comparison between WOCE/JGOFS and GEOSECS in the main Indian Ocean basin.2.2.3.  EVALUATION OF ERRORS An estimate of the random errors associated with the excess CO2 calculation can be made with a simple propagation of errors based on the fit to the GEOSECS data and the estimated precision of the WOCE/JGOFS data. With a standard deviation of 4.9 µmol kg-1 for the GEOSECS fit and an estimated long-term precision of ±2 µmol kg-1 in the WOCE/JGOFS TC02 values the excess CO2 error is estimated to be approximately ±5 µmol kg-1. This value compares well with the standard deviation of 3.5 µmol kg-1 for the excess CO2 below the maximum anthropogenic CO2 penetration depth (pressure> 1500 dbars).Systematic errors with this technique are very difficult to evaluate. The largest potential systematic error is probably associated with the surface water estimates. Because the same ∆pC02 value is used to estimate the TC02 for both years. the excess CO2 (1995 TC02 - 1978 TC02) is not very sensitive to potential errors associated with the actual ∆pC02 values used. The surface estimate is sensitive. however. to the assumption that the ∆pC02 has not changed over time (i.e.. that the surface ocean increase has kept pace with the atmospheric increase). It is not likely that the surface ocean has increased at a faster rate than the atmosphere. but it is conceivable that the rate is slower. The current assumption results in a total inventory of 0.8 Pg C in the surface layer. If the surface ocean were increasing at half the rate of the atmosphere. the systematic bias in the final inventory would be around 0.4 Pg C. Below the surface layer the most likely systematic error would result from the uncertainty in fitting the GEOSECS data. Systematic errors associated with calibration differences between cruises are potentially quite large. but the analysis and subsequent correction given in section 2.2.2 should remove these biases. The estimated uncertainty for the GEOSECS adjustment was ±3 µmol kg-1. If this value is integrated for the area north of 35°S between 200 m and the average penetration depth of the excess CO2 (~800 m). the potential error would be ±0.9 Pg C. Propagating the errors for the surface and deeper layers gives an estimated error of approximately ±1 Pg C in the total excess CO2 inventory. Clearly, there are other ways of estimating the potential errors in these calculations. but we feel that this is a reasonable estimate based on the available data.2.3.  ∆C* CALCULATIONSGruber et al. [1996] developed a method to estimate the total anthropogenic CO2 inventory which has accumulated in the water column since pre-industrial times. Although the details of the calculation are thoroughly discussed by Gruber et al. the basic concept of the calculation can be expressed in terms of the following equation:                C(anth)(µmol/kg) = C(m)-∆C(bio)-C(280)-∆C(dis)            (1)where     C(anth) anthropogenic carbon concentration;     C(m)    measured total carbon concentration;     ∆C(bio) change in TC02 as a result of biological activity;     C(280)  TC02 of waters in equilibrium with an atmospheric CO2             concentration of 280 µatm;     ∆C(dis) air-sea difference in CO2 concentration expressed in µmol             kg-1 of TC02.The Gruber et al. technique employs a new quasi-conservative tracer ∆C*, which is defined as the difference between the measured TC02 concentration, corrected for biology, and the concentration these waters would have at the surface in equilibrium with a pre-industrial atmosphere (i.e., ∆C* = C(m) - ∆C(bio) - C(280)). Rearranging (I) shows that ∆C* reflects both the anthropogenic signal and the air-sea CO2 difference (i.e., ∆C* = C(anth) + ∆C(dis)). The airsea disequilibrium component can then be discriminated from the anthropogenic signal using either information about the water age (e.g., from transient tracers such as CFCs or 3H-3He) or the distribution of ∆C* in regions not affected by the anthropogenic transient. The details of this technique will not be covered here except as necessary to explain small modifications that were necessary for use with the WOCE Indian Ocean data set.2.3.1.  PREFORMED ALKALINITY EQUATION The first modification to the Gruber et al. [1996] technique involved a recalculation of the preformed alkalinity equation. The preformed alkalinity (Alk^0) of a subsurface water parcel is an estimate of the alkalinity that the water had when it was last at the surface. This value is necessary to determine the equilibrium concentration (C(280)) of the waters. Gruber et al. generated a single global equation for estimating Alk^0 from salinity and the conservative tracer "PO" (PO = 02+l70*P) [Broecker, 1974] based on the data collected during GEOSECS, South Atlantic Ventilation Experiment, Transient Tracers in the Ocean/North Atlantic Study and Transient Tracers in the Ocean/ Tropical Atlantic Study. Given the limited representation of the Indian Ocean in these data and the improved quality of today's measurements, the Gruber et al. fit was examined for a possible bias with respect to the WOCE/JGOFS results. Alk^0 values calculated from the Gruber et al. equation were found to be, on average, 7 ±12 µmol kg-1 lower than the WOCE/JGOFS measured surface alkalinity values. Rather than making assumptions about which parameters would provide the best fit to the surface alkalinity data, several possible parameters were tested based on previously noted correlations. Although salinity has been shown to generally correlate very strongly with surface alkalinity [Brewer et al., 1986; Millero et al., 1998b], some areas, such as the high-latitude regions, require additional parameters to fit regional changes in alkalinity. Some investigators have used temperature as an additional variable [e.g., Chen and Pytkowicz, 1979; Chen, 1990; Millero et al., 1998b]. Others, such as Gruber et al. [1996], have used other conservative tracers to compensate for the regional differences. The best fit for the WOCE/JGOFS, INDIGO, and CIVA Indian Ocean data, with pressures less than 60 dbars, is given by (2):                 Alk^0 = 378.1+55.22 x S+0.0716 x PO-1.236 x θ            (2)Alk^0 has units of µmol kg-1 when salinity (S) is on the practical salinity scale, PO is in µmol kg-1, and potential temperature (θ) is in degrees Celsius. The standard error in the new Alk^0 estimate is ±8.0 µmol kg-1 based on 2250 data points. A standard ANOVA analysis of the fit shows that all four terms are highly significant (Table 1). Reevaluating the Alk^0 equation not only removed the 7 µmol kg-1 offset of Gruber's equation but also resulted in a 35% reduction in the uncertainty. TABLE 1: Results From ANOVA Analysis of Alk^0 Fit.         ____________________________________________________                   Coefficient  Standard  T Value   Pr(>|T|)                                 Error                   -----------  --------  --------  --------          Intercept  378.1       8.9       42.2715  0.0000          Salinity    55.22      0.23     235.0369  0.0000          PO           0.0716    0.0041    17.4693  0.0000          Theta       -1.236     0.061    -20.3697  0.0000         ____________________________________________________          The column labeled "Pr(>rr1)" gives the probability           that the T value in the previous column is larger           than the T table value in a student T test.

DENITRIFICATION CORRECTION A second modification to the original ∆C* technique was necessary to properly account for the anoxic regions in the northern Indian Ocean. The C(bio) term in (1) assumes that the remineralization of carbon in the interior of the ocean occurs in proportion to the oxygen uptake based on a standard Redfield type stoichiometry. The ratios used for these calculations were based on the global estimates of Anderson and Sarmiento [1994]. Gruber et al. [1996] demonstrated that the errors in the ∆C* calculation due to uncertainties in the C:O stoichiometric ratio only become significant for AOU values greater than 80 µmol kg-1. Given that most of the anthropogenic CO2 is found in relatively shallow waters with low AOU, this error, on average, is small. For some regions of the Arabian Sea, however, oxygen depletion can be quite extensive at relatively shallow depths [Sen Gupta et al., 1976; Deuser et al., 1978; Naqvi and Sen Gupta, 1985]. In areas where the waters become anoxic, denitrification can significantly alter the dissolved carbon to oxygen ratio [Naqvi and Sen Gupta, 1985; Anderson and Dyrssen, 1994; Gruber and Sarmiento, 1997]. The dissolved carbon generated by denitrification shows up as high ∆C* values as demonstrated at the northern end of the section in Figure 5a. The distribution of ∆C* values along the density surface σθ = 26.9-27.0 shows maximum values at both the northern and southern ends of the section. One would expect the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 to generate the highest values close to the outcrop region in the south, but this surface does not outcrop in the north. Following the methods of Gruber and Sarmiento [1997], the denitrification signal can be estimated using the N* tracer. N* is a quasi-conservative tracer which can be used to identify nitrogen (N) excess or deficits relative to phosphorus (P). Using the global equation of Gruber and Sarmiento [1997], N* is defined as                       N*(µmol/kg) = 0.87(N - 16P + 2.90)                 (3)Figure 5b shows the magnitude of the denitrification signal along the σθ = 26.9-27.0 surface. The N* values were converted from nitrogen units to µmol C kg-1 based on a denitrification carbon to nitrogen ratio of 106:-104 [Gruber and Sarmiento, 1997]. Negative values reflect nitrogen fixation, while positive values indicate denitrification. As expected, the values of N* are essentially zero in the main Indian Ocean basin but show a strong denitrification signal at middepths in the Arabian Sea. The low N* values at the north end of this surface (Figure 5b) are from the Bay of Bengal and show little or no denitrification in this region. Subtracting a denitrification correction term from the original ∆C* equation lowers the high ∆C* values at the northern end of the section leaving the expected maximum near the outcrop region (Figure 5c).The final definition for ∆C* as used in this work is given by (4)                  ∆C* = TCO2^meas - TCO2^(S,T,Alk^0,280)                      -(117/-170)(O2-O2^(sat))                      -(1/2)(TA-ALK^0+(16/-170))O2-O2^(sat))                      -(I06/-104)N*                                       (4)where TC02(meas), TA, and O2 are the measured concentrations for a given water sample in µmol kg-1. Alk^0 is the preformed alkalinity value as described in section 2.3.1. 02^(sat) is the calculated oxygen saturation value that the waters would have if they were adiabatically raised to the surface. TCO2^(S,T,Alk^0,280) is the TC02 value the waters would have at the surface with a TA value equal to Alk^0 and ƒC02 value of 280 µatm.2.3.3.  ESTIMATION OF AIR-SEA DISEQUILIBRIUM To isolate the anthropogenic CO2 component from ∆C*, the air-sea disequilibrium values (∆C(dis)) must be determined. Gruber et al. [1996] described two techniques for estimating these values on density surfaces. For deeper density surfaces one can assume that the waters far away from the outcrop region are free from anthropogenic CO2. The mean ∆C* values in these regions therefore reflect only the disequilibrium value. For shallower surfaces the air-sea disequilibrium can be inferred from the ∆C*I tracer.∆C*(t) is the difference between C* and the concentration the waters would have in equilibrium with the atmosphere at the time they were last at the surface. The time since the waters were in contact with the surface is estimated from CFC-12 age (t) and the atmospheric CO2 concentration history as a function of time (ƒC02{t(sample)-t}). The atmospheric CO2 time history from 1750 through 1996 was determined from a spline fit to ice core and measured atmospheric values [Neftel et al., 1994; Keeling and Whorf, 1996]. The CFC-12-based ages were determined following the technique described by Warner et al. [1996]. The apparent age of the water is determined by matching the CFC-12 partial pressure (pCFC-12) of the waters with the atmospheric CFC-12 concentration history (procedures and atmospheric time history provided by J. Bullister). Although CFCs do not give a perfect representation of the true calendar age of the waters, Doney et al. [1997] have shown that the CFC-12 and 3H-3He ages in the North Atlantic agree within 1.7 years for ages less than 30 years. Gruber [1998] successfully used both CFC and 3H-3He ages for his disequilibrium calculations in the Atlantic and has thoroughly discussed the assumptions and caveats associated with these techniques. The disequilibrium values on shallow density surfaces presented here were calculated using CFC-12 ages modified from the ∆C*(t) equation of Gruber [1998] to include the denitrification correction:        ∆C*(t) = TCO2^meas - TCO2^(S,T,Alk^0,ƒC02{t(sample)-t})              -(117/-170)(O2-O2^(sat))              -(1/2)(TA-ALK^0+(16/-170))O2-O2^(sat))              -(I06/-104)N*                                               (5)where TCO2^(S,T,Alk^0,ƒC02{t(sample)-t}) is the TC02 the waters would have at the surface with a TA value of Alk^0 and ƒC02 value in equilibrium with the atmospheric CO2 concentration at the time the waters were last at the surface (date of sample collection minus CFC age).The CFC age method was used for waters with densities less than σθ = 27.25 and CFC-12 ages less than 40 years. The anthropogenic CO2 of the waters with pressures less than 150 dbars or densities less than σθ = 25.95 was determined by subtracting the ∆C*(t) value estimated at each sample location from the corresponding ∆C* value. Given that the Indian Ocean does not extend into the high northern latitudes, the major outcrop region for Indian Ocean waters below the mixed layer is toward the south. Although other tracers might be used to identify multiple end-members, the CFC-12 ages on each density surface get steadily older toward the north, and the ∆C*(t) values are reasonably constant (see diamonds in Figure 6). This suggests that most of the water in the Indian Ocean is derived from the south or, at least in terms of the air-sea disequilibria, cannot be distinguished from other sources. The ∆C(dis) term for the main Indian Ocean basin therefore was determined from a mean ∆C*(t) value on each surface. The mean ∆C(dis) terms were then subtracted from the individual ∆C* values to determine the anthropogenic component. Table 2 summarizes the ∆C(dis) values for the density surfaces estimated exclusively from the ∆C*(t) method.One major exception to the southern source waters is observed in the Arabian Sea. Although none of the surfaces with σθ values greater than 26.0 outcrop in the Arabian Sea, a number of higher density surfaces do outcrop in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. These outcrops could provide pathways for the introduction of CFCs and anthropogenic CO2 into the northern Arabian Sea and could reset the disequilibria term. Wyrtki [1973] noted that the Red Sea and Persian Gulf waters mix in the Arabian Sea to form the high-salinity North Indian Intermediate Water (NIIW). The ∆C*(T) values in the Arabian Sea do vary significantly and generally have a strong correlation with salinity. The CFC-12 ages also begin to get younger toward the northern end of the Arabian Sea. These high salinity waters appear to have a higher disequilibria term than the lower-salinity waters that make up the majority of the Indian Ocean intermediate waters.To account for this phenomenon, the Arabian Sea waters (north of 5°N and west of 78°E) were isolated, and the ∆C*(t) values were fit against salinity with a linear regression. Thus this region was treated as a two-end-member mixing scenario between the high salinity NIIW and the lower-salinity waters of the main Indian Ocean basin. The ∆C(dis) values in this region were determined based on the relative contributions of the two end-members using salinity as a conservative tracer. The coefficients for the Arabian Sea fits are given in Table 2. The difference between the high salinity and lower-salinity disequilibria generally decreased as densities increased (note decreasing slope values in Table 2) to the point where the Arabian Sea disequilibria values were no longer distinguishable from the main Indian Ocean basin values. The additional terms were dropped for surfaces where the two end member mixing terms resulted in values within the error of the basin-wide mean (Table 2).As stated previously, the disequilibria term for the deeper, CFC free surfaces was determined directly from the mean ∆C* value of each density interval. Careful examination of the extent of CFC penetration along the density surface was used to limit data used in determining the ∆C(dis) term. Only regions where CFC concentrations were below a reasonable blank (0.005 pmol kg-1) were considered. The ∆C(dis) values determined using this method are summarized in the lower half of Table 3 (σθ > 27.5).FIGURE 5:  ∆C* values for data on the 26.9 - 27.0 σθ surface:            (a) calculated without denitrification, (b) denitri-           fication signal put in terms of ∆C*, (c) with            denitrification correction (i.e., data in Figure            5a minus the data in Figure 5b).Determination of the ∆C(dis) values for either shallow or deep surfaces is relatively straightforward using the techniques mentioned above. It is not straightforward, however, to estimate the ∆C(dis) values for intermediate levels where the CFC ages are relatively old and may be significantly influenced by mixing and yet the waters could have enough anthropogenic CO2 to influence the estimates based on ∆C*. The effect of using the ∆C* technique in waters that actually have anthropogenic CO2 would be to overestimate the ∆C(dis) term and thus underestimate the anthropogenic CO2, The effect of mixing on the CFC ages, however, generally results in an underestimation of the CFC age which would lead to an underestimation of the ∆C(dis) term and an overestimation of the anthropogenic CO2, The CFC age technique has additional problems in waters with σθ values greater than 27.25, because the waters with the younger ages are all found in the very high latitudes of the Southern Ocean and generally are not directly ventilated in these regions. Therefore the basic assumption that the ∆C(dis) term can be determined by following the density level to its outcrop and examining the younger waters there is not valid.TABLE 2: Values of ∆C(dis) Determined on Potential Density (σθ) Intervals_______________________________________________________________________  Potential    Main Basin     Main       Arabian    Arabian  Arabian   Density     Mean (SDM)    Basin #    Intercept    Slope    # of     Range                   of Points     (SD)       (SD)    Points -----------  ------------  ---------  ----------  --------  ------- 25.95-26.05   -1.3(±0.88)     56      -740(±92)   21.3(±3)  12 26.05-26.15   -0.7(±1.21)     42      -745(±130)  21.4(±4)  12 26.15-26.25   -3.4(±0.65)     63      -699(±76)   20.0(±2)  11 26.25-26.35   -4.8(±0.62)     61      -516(±90)   14.8(±3)  12 26.35-26.45   -5.6(±0.48)     83      -316(±84)    9.1(±2)  20 26.45-26.55   -7.1(±0.34)    103      -558(±87)   15.9(±2)  21 26.55-26.65   -7.2(±0.32)    123      -512(±53)   14.5(±I)  28 26.65-26.75   -8.9(±0.27)    152      -397(±52)   11.2(±I)  34 26.75-26.85   -9.1(±0.23)    254      -428(±66)   12.0(±2)  28 26.85-26.95  -11.2(±0.31)    209      -285(±115)   7.9(±3)   6 26.95-27.00  -12.2(±0.35)    104 27.00-27.05  -13.8(±0.48)     92 27.05-27.10  -15.2(±0.4O)     90 27.10-27.15  -16.3(±0.47)     84 27.15-27.20  -17.1(±0.51)     89 27.20-27.25  -19.5(±0.56)     74_______________________________________________________________________ Standard deviations (SD) are given for the slope and intercept terms  for the Arabian Sea data.

Values  of ∆C(dis) are given in µmol kg-l. Dashes indicate value not determined.As a general rule, the errors associated with the CFC age technique increase at higher density levels, and the errors associated with the ∆C* technique decrease at higher density levels. To minimize the errors in the final ∆C(dis) determination, waters with σθ values between 27.25 and 27.5 were evaluated using a combination of the two methods mentioned above. The 27.25 cut in the CFC age technique was chosen because this density corresponds with the core of the Antarctic Intermediate water and also generally the highest-density water that outcrops in this region [Wirtki, 1973; Levitus and Boyer, 1994; Levitus et al., 1994]. To help ensure that the ∆C(dis) values were determined on waters moving into the main Indian Ocean basin, mean ∆C*(t) values were only estimated from samples north of 35°S with CFC-12 ages less than 40 years. Mean ∆C* values were also determined on the same density surfaces for samples where CFCs were measured, but concentrations were below 0.005 pmol kg-1. The final mean value used for the ∆C(dis) correction on each surface was determined from the mean of the combined individual estimates from each method (Table 3).Examination of the individual and combined means in Table 3 indicates that there is a sizeable spread in the estimates from the two techniques in the overlap region. This difference is maximized since these density levels are pushing the limits of both techniques, and the errors in both estimates serve to increase this difference. Since the number of points available from the CFC age technique generally decreased at greater density levels and the number of points from the ∆C* technique generally increased at greater density levels, the mean becomes progressively more heavily weighted toward the ∆C* technique as the density levels increased. Although this is not the ideal solution, we believe that this minimizes the potential errors as much as possible. The technique used to estimate final ∆C(dis) values in this region could systematically bias the anthropogenic CO2 inventory estimates. The magnitude of this potential error on the final inventory was estimated to be approximately ±1.8 Pg C by integrating the difference between the two methods over the effected water volume. This estimate represents a maximum potential error since the known limitations of each method work to increase the differences in ∆C(dis).2.3.4.  TIME ADJUSTMENT FOR INDIGO DATA One difficulty with combining data from different cruises for a time-dependent calculation like the anthropogenic CO2 inventory is the issue of getting the data sets referenced to a common time. One of the advantages of the WOCE/JGOFS Indian Ocean survey data is the fact that all of the samples were collected in a little over a year's time. In terms of the CO2 inventory this is essentially a synoptic data set. The couple of years between the CIVA-1 cruise and the WOCE/JGOFS data are also not distinguishable in terms of the anthropogenic increase. The INDIGO data, however, were collected 8-10 years before the WOCE/JGOFS data set and must be adjusted to reflect the anthropogenic uptake during that time. Unfortunately, any correction of this sort can have large errors and potentially bias the results. This problem must be weighed against the errors of ignoring the time difference between cruises or omitting these data entirely. The decision to correct the INDIGO data was based on two factors. First, analysis of the change in anthropogenic inventory between GEOSECS and WOCE (discussed below) indicated that a significant fraction of the total anthropogenic uptake has occurred in the past 2 decades. Second, careful examination of objective maps of anthropogenic CO2 made prior to the INDIGO correction showed obvious, anomalously low concentrations in the regions strongly dependent on the INDIGO data. Two different adjustment functions were made depending on whether the stations were located in the main Indian Ocean basin or in the Southern Ocean.North of 30°S, where portions of the INDIGO data were located relatively near WOCE stations, a crossover comparison of the INDIGO anthropogenic CO2 concentrations as a function of density was made with the WOCE/JGOFS data in that region. The difference between the two data sets was evaluated at σθ intervals of 0.05 from the surface to σθ = 27.5 and added to the INDIGO data. This correction ranged from approximately 12 µmol kg-1 at the surface down to zero at 27.5.South of 30°S, there were very few WOCE or CIVA-1 stations close enough for a proper crossover comparison. It was clear from the northern data, however, that some correction was necessary. Given that the isolines for most properties in the Southern Ocean run east-west, we decided to correct the southern INDIGO data based on a crossover comparison with all results from CIVA-1 and WOCE cruises in that region. The average adjustment for the southern stations was approximately 11 µmol kg-l over the same density range. The magnitude of the corrections in both regions is consistent with the expected increase over the time period between cruises.2.3.5.  EVALUATION OF ERRORS Error evaluation is much more difficult for the ∆C* method than for the time series approach because of potential systematic errors associated with some of the parameters (Le., the biological correction). The random errors associated with the anthropogenic CO2 can be determined by propagating through the precision of the various measurements required for the calculation of (4). {σ(C(anth))}^2 = {σ(C)}^2 + {σ(C(eq))}^2               + {(-R(CO) - 0.5R(NO))σ(O(2))}^2               + {(R(CO) + 0.5R(NO))σ(O(2[sat]))}^2                                     ∂C(eq)               + {-0.5σ(TA)}^2 + {(- ------ + 0.5)σ(Alk^0)}^2                                      ∂TA               + {0.8667σ(N)}^2 + +{13.867σ(P)}^2                              N-16P+2.9               + {0.8667(-P - --------- )σ(R(N:P[nitr]))}^2                                 120               + {-0.00111(N - 16P + 2.9)σ(R(N:P[denitr]))}^2               - {σ(∆C(dis))}^2                                           (6)where       σ(C)         = 2 µmol kg-1 ;      σ(C(eq))     = 4 µmol kg-1 ;      σ(O(2))      = 1 µmol kg-1 ;      σ(O(2[sat])) = 4 µmol kg-1 ;      σ(TA)        = 4 µmol kg-1 ;      ∂C(eq)      -------      = 0.842 ;      ∂TA      σ(Alk^0)     = 7.8 µmol kg-1 ;      σ(N)         = 0.2 µmol kg-1 ;      σ(P)         = 0.02 µmol kg-1 ;      σ(R(N:P[nitr])) = 0.25 ;      σ(R(N:P[denitr])) = 15The equation for the random error analysis is adapted from Gruber et al. [1996] (excluding those terms that involve the C:O Redfield error) with additional terms for the error propagation of the N* correction [Gruber and Sarmiento, 1997]. The terms involving the C:O are evaluated separately below because the random errors cannot be isolated from potential systematic errors. The sigma values used in (6) were either taken from the appropriate WOCE cruise reports or from previously determined estimates of Gruber et al. [1996] and Gruber andSarmiento [1997]. The error in the ∆C(dis) term is taken from the average value for the standard deviation of the mean for the examined surfaces (σ(∆C(dis)) = 0.5 µmol kg-1). The formulation given in (6) results in an estimated error of 6.1 µmol kg-1. This estimate is larger than the standard deviation of the ∆C* values below the deepest anthropogenic CO2 penetration depth (±2.8 µmol kg-1 for pressure > 2000 dbars) suggesting that the propagated errors may be a maximum estimate of the random variability.The potential systematic errors associated with the anthropogenic CO2 calculation are much more difficult to evaluate. The random error estimate above includes all terms except those associated with the C:O biological correction. Although other terms involving N:O and N:P corrections potentially have systematic offsets associated with errors in the ratio estimates, the only potentially significant errors involve the C:O corrections [Gruber et al., 1996; Gruber, 1998].There is evidence, however, that the Anderson and Sarmiento [1994] stoichiometric ratios must be reasonably close to the actual remineralization ratios observed in the Indian Ocean. Figure 6 is a plot of ∆C*t based on CFC-12 ages for the density interval from σθ = 27.1 to σθ = 27.15. The diamonds are the values calculated from (5). These values represent the preserved air-sea disequilibrium value for the past 40 years and should be constant if the air-sea disequilibrium has not changed over time (Le., that the surface ocean CO2 is increasing at the same rate at the atmosphere). A linear regression of the diamonds in Figure 6 yields a slope that is not significantly different from zero. The circles and pluses are the ∆C*t values one would get by using a C:O ratio of -0.60 and -0.78 in (5), respectively. These C:O values represent one standard deviation from the Anderson and Sarmiento [1994] mean value of 0.69. The -0.60 ratio results in values with a significant positive slope. This slope would imply that the surface ocean CO2 is increasing much slower than the atmospheric increase. While this is possible, the -0.60 ratio is much larger than historical Redfield estimates and would be very difficult to justify. The -0.78 ratio is more typical of historical estimates but results in a significant negative slope in the ∆C*t values with time. A negative slope would imply that carbon is accumulating in the ocean faster than the atmosphere. Neither of these scenarios seems very likely. The fact that none of the ∆C*t values on the examined surfaces exhibit a statistically significant slope suggests that the C:O value of -0.69 does accurately represent the remineralization ratio for these waters and supports the methodology of taking a mean value of ∆C*t on these density surfaces.FIGURE 6:  Plot of ∆C*t based on CFC-12 ages for the density            interval from σθ =27.1 to 27.15 versus CFC-12 age.            The diamonds were calculated using the Anderson            and Sarmiento [1994] c:o (-0.69). The circles and            pluses were calculated from C:O of -0.60 and -0.78,            respectively. Lines and text give results from a            linear regression of the three sets of data.A sensitivity study was also used to evaluate the potential error associated with an incorrect C:O value. Two additional estimates of anthropogenic CO2 were determined using the -0.60 and -0.78 C:O values. Since the C:O correction applies to both ∆C* and the ∆C*(t) terms, the disequilibrium values were reevaluated in the same manner as described above. The range of anthropogenic values from these three estimates varied as a function of apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) from 0.0 to 22 with an average difference of only 4.2 µmol kg-1. Because the C:O correction affects both the ∆C* and ∆C*(t) terms together, much of the systematic error in the final anthropogenic estimate (∆C*-∆C*(t)) cancels out.2.4. INVENTORY ESTIMATESBasin-wide anthropogenic and excess CO2 concentrations (WOCE/JGOFS - GEOSECS) were evaluated on a 1° grid at 100 m intervals between the surface and 2600 m using the objective mapping techniques of Sarmiento et al. [1982]. Total anthropogenic CO2 was mapped over an area from 20° to 120°E and 70°S to 30°N (excluding areas of land, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the South China Sea). Because the WOCE/JGOFS data set did not cover much of the Southern Ocean, the excess CO2 maps were limited to the area north of 35°S. The values at each level were multiplied by the volume of water in the 100 m slab and summed to generate the total anthropogenic or excess CO2 inventory. The method of integrating mapped surfaces compared very well with the technique of vertically integrating each station and mapping the station integrals.It is extremely difficult to evaluate a reasonable estimate of the potential errors associated with the inventory estimates. A simple propagation of errors implies that the random errors associated with any individual anthropogenic estimate is approximately ±6.1 µmol kg-1, but these errors should essentially cancel out for an integrated inventory based on nearly 25,000 individual estimates. Systematic errors have by far the largest impact on the inventory estimates. Potential errors as large as ±1.8 Pg C have been estimated for the ∆C(dis) term. Sensitivity studies with the C:O variations give a range of total inventory estimates of ±2.5 Pg C. Other systematic errors could also be generated from the denitrification term, the terms involving N:0, the time correction for the INDIGO data, and the mapping routines used in the inventory estimates. The magnitude of these errors is believed to be much smaller than the uncertainty in either the C:O correction or the ∆C(dis) determination. Propagation of the two estimated uncertainties gives an overall error of approximately ±3 Pg C for the total inventory. An error of roughly 15% is comparable to previous error estimates using this technique [Gruber et al., 1996; Gruber, 1998]. Errors for regional inventories are assumed to scale to the total.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe excess CO2 concentrations for the Indian Ocean range from 0 to 25 µmol kg-1. The most prominent feature in the excess CO2distribution, as shown with representative sections in the eastern and western Indian Ocean (Figure 7), is the maximum in concentrations at midlatitudes (~40°S). This maximum is coincident with the relatively strong gradient in surface density associated with the Subtropical Convergence and the transition from the high salinity subtropical gyre waters to the low-salinity Antarctic waters. The outcropping of these density surfaces and subsequent sinking of surface waters provides a pathway for excess CO2 to enter the interior of the ocean. Relatively high excess CO2 concentrations can also be observed at the very northern end of the western section (Figure 7a). Although not readily evident from this section, the distribution of concentration gradients indicates that excess CO2 is entering the northern Indian Ocean from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea regions. This is likely to result from the outcropping of density surfaces in these areas which are not ventilated in the main Indian Ocean basin. The implied Red Sea and Persian Gulf sources of CO2 are consistent with uptake estimates of anthropogenic CO2 in these areas as observed by Papaud and Poisson [1986]. The third major feature observed in the excess CO2 distribution is a dramatic shoaling of the excess CO2 isolines south of approximately 40°S. Poisson and Chen [1987] attributed the low anthropogenic CO2 concentrations in Antarctic Bottom Water to a combination of the pack sea ice blocking air-sea gas exchange and the upwelling of old Weddell Deep Water. This explanation is consistent with the observed excess CO2 distributions in this study.The general features observed with excess CO2 are also observed in the anthropogenic CO2 distribution (Figure 8). The range of values, however, extends up to 55 µmol kg-1. The maximum depth of the 5 µmol kg-1 contour is approximately 1300 m at around 40°S, only 200 m deeper than the maximum depth of the 5 µmol kg-1 contour of excess CO2, The similarity in maximum penetration depth between the 200 year and the 18 year anthropogenic CO2 accumulation, together with the wide range of depths covered by the 5 µmol kg-1 isoline, indicates that the primary pathway for CO2 to enter the ocean's interior is from movement along isopycnals, not simple diffusion or cross isopycnal mixing from the surface. The 1300 m penetration results from the downwarping of the isopycnals in the region of the Subtropical Convergence. Likewise, the low anthropogenic CO2 concentrations in the high-latitude Southern Ocean result from the compression and shoaling of isopycnal surfaces in that region. Although the complex oceanography of the Southern Ocean may call into question some of the assumptions regarding mixing and nutrient uptake ratios with these techniques, both the time series excess CO2 and the ∆C* anthropogenic CO2calculations clearly indicate that the anthropogenic CO2 concentrations south of approximately 50°S are relatively small.The distribution of anthropogenic CO2 determined in this study is similar to the distribution presented by Chen and Chen [1989] based on GEOSECS and INDIGO data. Although the penetration depth at 40°S was slightly deeper than observed with this study (1400-1600 m for the 5 µmol kg-1 isoline), Chen and Chen also observed a significant shoaling of the anthropogenic CO2 isolines toward the south. They suggest that anthropogenic CO2 has only penetrated a few hundred meters into the high-latitude (>50°S) Southern Ocean.There has been debate in the literature over recent years as to the importance of the Southern Ocean as a sink for anthropogenic CO2 [e.g., Sarmiento and Sundquist, 1992; Keeling et al., 1989; Tans et al., 1990]. Most of the recent data-based estimates, however, indicate a relatively small Southern Ocean sink [Poisson and Chen, 1987; Murphy et al., 1991; Gruber, 1998; this study]. The lack of observed anthropogenic CO2 in the Southern Ocean is also qualitatively consistent with ∆14C estimates which show no measurable storage of bomb 14C in the Southern Ocean since GEOSECS [Leboucher et al., 1998; R. Key, unpublished data, 1998]. Recent studies by Bullister et al. [1998], which show evidence of deep CFC penetration in the Southern Ocean, may appear to contradict these low anthropogenic CO2 estimates, but we believe it is further evidence that one must be careful when inferring anthropogenic carbon distributions from other tracers. One possible explanation of this apparent discrepancy may be the CFC equilibration rate of days which is significantly faster than the CO2 equilibration time of months [e.g., England, 1995; Warner and Weiss, 1985; Tans et al., 1990]. This can become an issue in the Southern Ocean where upwelling and convection may allow the CFCs to equilibrate to a greater extent than the CO2, Again, we acknowledge the limitations of the methods used in the Southern Ocean, and it is possible that the apparent discrepancy in the CFC penetration versus the CO2 penetration may also be an issue of detection limits. With a detection limit that is approximately 6 µmol kg-1, it is not possible to say with this technique that the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 below 500 m at 60°S is zero. However, we can say with some confidence that the concentration is not 10 µmol kg-1 or greater. Since there is no natural oceanic source of CFCs and these compounds are not biologically utilized, the ability to detect them is much greater. If mixing has diluted the anthropogenic signal to concentrations just below detection limits, it is possible that carbon measurement based techniques would underestimate the Southern Ocean sink.FIGURE 7:  Sections of excess CO2 along (a) -57°E and (b) -92°E.            Dots indicate sample locations used in sections.  Note            that I6S data along 30°E were brought into the line of            section for contours south of 40°S in Figure 7a.The total anthropogenic CO2 inventory for the main Indian Ocean basin (north of 35°S) was 13.6±2 Pg C in 1995. The increase in CO2 inventory since GEOSECS was 4.1±1 Pg C for the same area. This represents a nearly 30% increase in the past 18 years relative to the total accumulation since pre-industrial times. The relative oceanic increase is very similar to the 31% increase observed in atmospheric concentrations over the same time period [Keeling and Whorf, 1996]. This similarity suggests that the oceans, at least for now, are keeping pace with the rise in atmospheric CO2, Approximately 6.7±1 Pg C are stored in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean giving a total Indian Ocean inventory (between 20° and 120°E) of 20.3±3 Pg C in 1995.To put these results in a global perspective, the total inventory for the Indian Ocean is only half that of the Atlantic (40±6 Pg C [Gruber, 1998]), but it contains an ocean volume that is nearly 80% of the Atlantic. The main difference between the two oceans, of course, is that the Indian Ocean does not have the high northern latitude sink that the Atlantic has. The big unknown at this point is the anthropogenic inventory of the Pacific. With nearly 50% of the total ocean volume the Pacific has the potential to be the largest oceanic reservoir for anthropogenic CO2.4. COMPARISON WITH PRINCETON OCEAN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY MODELCurrent IPCC anthropogenic estimates are primarily based on global carbon models. Ultimately, these models are necessary to predict the oceanic response to future climate scenarios. It is important, however, to validate these models. One way to compare results is to examine profiles of the average anthropogenic concentrations such as those shown in Figure 9. The model presented here is the Princeton Ocean Biogeochemistry Model (OBM). The Princeton OBM is based on the circulation of Toggweiler et al. [1989] with explicit parameterization for the biological and solubility carbon pumps [Sarmiento et al., 1995; Murnane et al., 1998]. On this scale the model-based concentrations for both the total anthropogenic CO2 and the increase since GEOSECS appear to be reasonably consistent with the data. The primary difference is slightly higher values at middepths in the data-based estimates. A more detailed examination, however, indicates that the regional distribution of the model-based estimates is significantly different than the data-based distribution. Figure 10 presents maps of the vertically integrated excess CO2 normalized to a unit area. The model shows a consistent decrease in column inventory toward the north. The lowest inventories in the data-based map are in a narrow band just south of the equator. The highest values are found in the southeastern Indian Ocean. Relatively high values are also observed in the Arabian Sea in the regions near the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The small patch of lower values immediately outside the Gulf of Aden does not result from low concentrations but rather results from the shallow water depth associated with the mid-ocean ridge in that area. The low values east of there, however, do result from lower concentrations near the southern tip of India. The total model-based inventory for the region north of 35°S is approximately 0.61 times the data-based inventory (Table 4). FIGURE 8:  Sections of anthropogenic CO2 along (a) -57°E and            (b) -92°E. Dots indicate sample locations used in sections.FIGURE 9:  Profile of area weighted mean anthropogenic CO2            concentrations for model (solid symbols) and            data-based (open symbols) estimates for main            Indian Ocean basin (north of 35°S). Circles            show increase since GEOSECS (1978-1995). Triangles            show total increase since pre-industrial times.Figure II shows maps of total anthropogenic CO2 column inventory. As with the excess CO2, the model predicts decreasing anthropogenic concentrations north of 35°S. The data-based distribution pattern is similar to the data-based excess C02 pattern with a minimum inventory band south of the equator and higher values toward the north and south. Similar to the findings with excess CO2, the model-based anthropogenic inventory north of 35°S is approximately 0.68 times the data-based inventory (Table 4). The largest difference between the data-based results and the model is evident, however, in the Southern Ocean (south of 35°S). In this region the model anthropogenic inventory is nearly 2.6 times the data-based inventory (Table 4). The primary reason for this difference is the presence of a large convective cell in the model at approximately 55°S and 90°E in the Southern Ocean. This is a region of intense, unrealistic convection which pumps relatively high concentrations of anthropogenic CO2 down in excess of 4000 m. This problem is a known shortcoming with the mixing scheme used in several GCMs [e.g., England, 1995] but has never before been quantified in terms of its direct effect on anthropogenic CO2 storage by the models. It is beyond the scope of this paper to examine the details of the model physics; however, this same general trend of getting too much anthropogenic CO2 into the Southern Ocean has been observed in comparisons with three other global carbon models with a range of mixing and advective schemes [C. Sabine, unpublished results, 1998]. This cursory comparison with the Princeton OBM clearly demonstrates the diagnostic usefulness of comparing the data distributions with models.5. CONCLUSIONSAlthough the general techniques proposed by Gruber et al. [1996] and Wallace [1995] can be important tools for estimating global anthropogenic CO2, careful consideration must be used when applying these techniques to new regions. Complicating factors such as those found in the Arabian Sea can influence the quality of the estimates if not properly addressed. An additional term had to be added to the basic ∆C* calculation to account for denitrification in the Arabian basin. For the excess CO2 calculations a categorical variable was used to remove regional biases in the GEOSECS fit.With the above mentioned modifications the anthropogenic inventory of the Indian Ocean was shown to be relatively small, approximately half of that found in the Atlantic. This study provides an important baseline for future studies of the Indian Ocean. The calculations presented here suggest that the oceanic increase in carbon storage (30%) has roughly kept pace with the atmosspheric increase (31%) over the past 18 years. Models predict that this trend is likely to change as atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise in the future [Sarmiento et al., 1995]. As more CO2 enters the ocean, the carbonate ion concentration will become depleted. This will decrease the buffering capacity of the ocean and its ability to continue carbon uptake at the current rate. Comparison of future survey cruises in the Indian Ocean with the anthropogenic and total carbon values from this study will allow us to document future changes in ocean chemistry and better understand the oceanic response to global change. FIGURE 10: Maps of vertically integrated excess CO2 based on            (a) data and (b) model estimates.

The methods presented here provide a two pointcalibration for examining the response of the models toobserved atmospheric CO2 increases. The anthropogenic CO2 datacan also be subtracted from the TC02 measurements to provide anestimate of the pre-industrial TC02 distribution. Comparing theseestimates with the steady state model distributions can provideinsight into whether differences in the model and data-basedanthropogenic inventories result from problems with the uptakeparameterization or the basic physics and initialization parametersof the model. This paper is just the first step in the interpretation ofthe WOCE/JGOFS data set. Subsequent papers will analyze additionalcruise data as they become available. Together. these analyseswill significantly improve our understanding of the globalcarbon cycle.FIGURE 11: Maps of vertically integrated anthropogenic CO2            based on (a) data and (b) model estimates.

All of the cruises used the R/V Knorr operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.  A total of 1244hydrographic stations were occupied with radiocarbon sampling on 366 stations. The radiocarbon stations are shown as black dots in Figure 1.  To give an indication of the total radiocarbon coverage for the Indian Ocean, the figure includes radiocarbon stations from WOCE sections S4I (Key, 1999; red dots) and I6S (Leboucher, et al., 1999; white dots) and from the earlier GEOSECS (Stuiver and Ostlund, 1983; brown dots) and INDIGO (Bard, et al., 1988; yellow dots) expeditions.  Specific summary information on the 9 WOCE survey cruises is given in Table 1. TABLE 1: Summary for Survey Sections          __________________________________________________________________                      Chief                               ∆14C     ∆14C          Cruise    Scientist     Start       End       Stations  Samples            ------  ------------  ----------  ----------  --------  --------          I8SI9S  M.

Personnel for the remainder of the cruises came from the Ocean Tracer Lab (OTL Princeton University) and included G. McDonald, A. Doerty, R. Key, T. Key, and R. Rotter. ∆14C (and accompanying δ13C) analyses were performed at the National Ocean Sciences AMS Facility (NOSAMS) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. R. Key collected the data from NOSAMS, merged the files with hydrographic data, assigned quality control flags to the ∆14C and submitted the results to the WOCE office (4/02).  R. Key is P.I. for the 14C data.  P. Quay (U.W.) and A. McNichol (WHOI/NOSAMS) are P.I.s for the 13C data. In addition to collecting samples the shipboard 14C person was also responsible for operation of the underway pCO2 system provided by the OTL (Sabine and Key, 1997; Sabine, et al., 2000). 3.0 Results This ∆14C data set and any changes or additions supersedes any prior release. 3.1 Hydrography Hydrographic data from these cruises were submitted to the WOCE office by the chief scientists and are described in various reports which are available from the web site (http://whpo.ucsd.edu/data/tables/onetime/1tim_ind.htm). 3.2 ∆14C The ∆14C values described here were originally distributed in the NOSAMS data reports listed in Table 2 and given in full in the References.

Table 3 summarizes the number of samples analyzed and the quality control flags assigned for each cruise.  Approximately 98% of the samples collected were deemed to be "good" (flagged 2 or 6).  Quality flag values were assigned to all ∆14C measurements using the code defined in Table 0.2 of WHP Office Report WHPO 91-1 Rev. 2 section 4.5.2. (Joyce, et al., 1994).  No measured values have been removed from this data set. TABLE 3: Sample Analysis and QC Summary                    _______________________________________                            Samples     QC Flag Totals                      Cruise  Analyzed  2    3   4   5   6                      ------  -------- ---  --- --- --- ---                    I8SI9S    662    636   6   8   0  12                    I9N       368    354   4   3   4   3                      I8NI5E    416    401   6   0   2   7                      I3        463    448   5   0   1   9                      I5WI4     366    342   3   1   5  15                      I7N       383    370   3   0  10   0                      I1        430    421   2   2   4   1                      I10       127    127   0   0   0   0                      I2        655    636  13   2   4   0                      Total    3870   3735  42  16  30  47                     _______________________________________4.0 Data Summary Figures 2-6 summarize the ∆14C data collected during the Indian Ocean survey. Only ∆14C measurements with a quality flag value of 2 ("good") or 6 ("replicate") are included in the figures.  Figure 2 shows the ∆14C values with 2σ error bars plotted as a function of pressure.  The mid depth ∆14C minimum which occurs around 2500 meters in the Pacific is not apparent in these data.In fact, there is very little variation in the deep and bottom water other than the previously reported decrease in ∆14C from south to north. All of the samples collected at a depth greater than 1000 meters have a mean ∆14C = -165.±25‰ (standard error = 0.5‰ with n=2086).  A substantial fraction of this variability is due to the difference between the Southern Ocean and main basin deep waters. Figure 3 shows the deep (>1000m) ∆14C values plotted against silicate.  The black and red points are from north and south of 35°S, respectively.  The straight line shown in the figure is the least squares regression relationship derived by Broecker et al. (1995) based on the GEOSECS global data set. According to their analysis, this line (∆14C = -70 - Si) represents the relationship between naturally occurring radiocarbon and silicate for most of the ocean.  They noted that the technique could not be simply applied at high latitudes as confirmed by this data set. Figure 4 shows all of the radiocarbon values plotted against potential alkalinity (defined as [alkalinity + nitrate]*35/salinity).  The straight line is the regression fit (14C = -59 -0.962(PALK-2320) derived by Rubin and Key (2002) using GEOSECS measurements assumed to have no bomb-produced ∆14C.  The value 2320 is the estimated surface ocean mean potential alkalinity.  As with Figure 3 the black and red points in Figure 4 indicate measurements taken north and south of 35°S, respectively. Unlike the silicate plot (Figure 3), there is no apparent difference in the relationship for Southern Ocean vs Indian Ocean deep waters.  The distance a point falls above the regression line is an estimate of the bomb radiocarbon contamination for the sample. Figures 5-9 show gridded sections of the ∆14C data. In each figure the water column is divided into upper (0-1000m) and lower (1000-bottom) portions.  The data were gridded using the loess method (Chambers et al., 1983; Chambers and Hastie, 1991; Cleveland,1979; Cleveland and Devlin, 1988).  The span for the fits was adjusted to be minimum and yet capture the large scale features.  The contour interval is 10‰ for the upper water column and 20‰ for intermediate and deep water. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the meridional ∆14C distribution in the eastern and western Indian Ocean.  In both figures the distribution pattern is very similar to that seen in the Pacific Ocean WOCE samples.  In the Pacific the maximum ∆14C values were frequently found in shallow water, but beneath the surface.  In the Indian Ocean data a subsurface maximum is not so common.  Both sections show intrusion of Circumpolar Deep Water from the south along the bottom and return flow of deep water at 2000-3000m.  As with the Pacifiic the middepth waters have the lowest ∆14C values, however the middepth Indian Ocean waters have significantly higher values that corresponding Pacific waters.  This pattern is consistent with a mean ageing of waters from the Atlantic to Indian to Pacific. Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 show zonal ∆14C sections along the WOCE lines I1 (~10°N), I2(~8°S) and I3(~20°S).  Except for the western ends, the ∆14C contours in the upper kilometer are relatively flat.  In each section the deep waters of the western basins have somewhat higher ∆14C than at the same depth in the eastern basins.  The strength of this signal decreases from south to north and is almost certainly due to the western basins having a higher fraction of North Atlantic Deep Water. Figure 10 shows the meridional distribution of bomb produced ∆14C (via Rubin and Key, 2002) in the eastern and western Indian Ocean.  The eastern section used all WOCE samples collected at depths less than 1000m and east of 85°E.  The western section uses the same depth range, but samples from west of 75°E.  Both sections are contoured and colored in potential density space rather against depth.  One might expect a priori that the distributions would differ north of the equator due to the geography and difference in chemistry between the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.  Perhaps unexpected is the fact that the distributions differ significantly as far as 40°S.  In the eastern section the maximum bomb ∆14C values are found between 40°S and 20°S and more or less uniformly from the surface down to the level where σθ~26.5.  The western section has a maximum in the same latitude range but in this case the maximum occurs as a subsurface lens. Figure  1: AMS 14C station map for WOCE S4I. Figure  2: ∆14C results shown with 2σ error bars. Figure  3: ∆14C as a function of silicate for samples collected deeper than            1000m.  The black points are from north of 35°S and the red points            south of 35°.  The straight line shows the relationship proposed by            Broecker, et al., 1995 (∆14C = -70 - Si with radiocarbon in ‰ and            silicate in µmol/kg). Figure  4: Based on the potential alkalinity method (Rubin and Key, 2002), the            samples which plot above the line and have potential alkalinity            values less than about 2400 µmole/kg are contaminated with bomb-           produced 14C. Figure  5: ∆14C, along I8S and I9N in the eastern Indian Ocean. Figure  6: ∆14C along I7 in the western Indian Ocean. Figure  7: ∆14C along I1 in the northern Indian Ocean. Figure  8: ∆14C along I2 in the southern tropical Indian Ocean. Figure  9: ∆14C along I3 in the southern subtropical Indian Ocean at            approximately 20°S. . Figure 10: Mean bomb-produced ∆14C sections in the eastern (A) and western            (B) Indian Ocean, shown in potential density space for samples from            the upper 1000m. Figure 11: (A) ∆14C and (B) bomb-produced ∆14C for the surface Indian Ocean            from WOCE measurements. Figure 12: (A) ∆14C and (B) bomb-produced ∆14C on σθ=24.0. Figure 13: (A) ∆14C and (B) bomb-produced ∆14C on σθ=25.0 Figure 14: (A) ∆14C and (B) bomb-produced ∆14C on σθ=26.0 Figure 15: (A) ∆14C and (B) bomb-produced ∆14C on σθ=26.5 Figure 16: (A) ∆14C and (B) bomb-produced ∆14C on σθ=26.8 Figure 17: (A) ∆14C and bomb-produced (B) ∆14C on σθ=27.1 5.0 REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION Bard, E., M.

I           compared the water sample data to data I had retrieved in April           1995 from the Indian Ocean preliminary data site at WHOI available           to Indian Ocean PIs (I work for Arnold Gordon).  The data from           your WHPO site has less resolution than the data from 1995.  The           oxygens in the hydro files have a resolution of only one decimal           place, compared to three in 1995.  Phosphate has two compared to           three.  The difference seems to be more than a rounding error, as           the 1995 data rounded to one decimal place does not result in the           value I retrieved.  I suppose if the data were updated and then           rounded, this could account for the difference. Also, I see in the           data description that the CTD data was reformatted by WHPO.  The           data downloaded is still in the original WHOI format, dated Aug           1995.  Is there a final version?   - Phil Mele          08/17/99  Anderson     SUM/HYD          Data Update:       No errors detected          I have checked the .sum and .sea/.hyd files for lines A08, A12,           I08S/I09S, and P14S.  The files on the web page for A08 and           I08S/I09S adhere to the WHP format specifications, and I have run           them over the programs wocecvt and sumchk without any errors.           09/29/99  Falkner      BA               Update Needed:     Data quallity does not meet WOCE standards          The quality of the Ba data from most WOCE legs in the Indian Ocean           turned out to be quite  poor; far worse than attainable analytical           precision (+/-20% as opposed to 2%). We recorded many vials which           came back with loose caps and evaporation associated with that           seems to be the primary problem.  The only hope I have of           producing a decent data set is to run both Ba and a conservative           element simultaneously and then relating that to the original           salinity of the sample.  We will be taking delivery on a high           resolution ICPMS here at OSU sometime this winter which would make           the project analytically feasible and economical.  I do not           presently have the funds in hand to do this and so have archived           the samples for the time being. I don't think the WHPO would           derive any benefit from the present data set.  -- KKF          12/16/99  Bullister    BTLNBR           Update Needed:     stations missing or replicated          Stations 1-3 are absent (they were present iin an earlier versioni           of the file)          sta 39 samp 1 is repeated 19 times          sta 129 samp 1 is repeated 4 times          12/16/99  Bullister    CFCs             Submitted          Data are Final & Public          Post these revised files at the web site, with the CFC data           'public' for these cruises.          02/08/00  Newton       CFCs/CO2         Website UpDate     Date Merged into hyd file          Notes on merging of CFC's, TCARBN, ALKALI   316N145_5   I08S/09S            In i08shy.txt.

The CTD files have the same           problem with oxygen - e.g. values in ml/l interpreted as umol/kg.                    Date      Contact      Data Type        Action             Summary--------  -----------  ---------------  -----------------  -------------------          03/24/00  Schlosser    He/Tr            Data are Public    Not final          As mentioned in my recent message, we will release our data with a           flag that indicates that they are not yet final. We started the           process of transferring the data and we will continue with the           transfer during the next weeks. I had listed the expected order of           delivery in my last message.          04/25/00  Anderson     NUTs             Data Update:       Units changed from UMOL/L to UMOL/KG          Nutrients were labeled UMOL/KG but were really UMOL/L. Converted           mislabeled nutrients from UMOL/L to UMOL/KG. Subtracted NITRIT           from NO2+NO3 to get NITRAT.            04/25/00  Anderson     NUTs/CTDOXY      Update Needed      Correct NUTs Units not yet online          In March of 1998 I reformatted (this was before our accepted           format was in place) I08S, I09S.  At that time I noted that the O2           was in ML/L and the nuts had the wrong unit headings, which I           changed from UMOL/KG to UMOL/L.  Perhaps that file was never put           up on the web site, but the file there now has the O2 in the           correct units UMOL/KG, and the nuts are as stated by Orsi in           UMOL/L but say UNOL/KG.  Also there is NO2+NO3 and NITRIT.  All of           the above I can correct in a short period of time.  Should I go           ahead and do this?             I note that the ctd files for this line still have O2 in  ml/l.            04/27/00  Diggs        NUTs/CTDOXY      Website Update:    Reformatted NUTs/CTDOXY online          I have replaced the older I08S/I09S files with the ones that           Sarilee recently sent.

Also,           did Joe Jennings and Lou Gordon ever review the I1 nutrients?  All           I have seen is the shipboard data, and the silicic acid values           there for Stations 973, 974, 975, and 996 appear high at all           depths, suggestive of a standardization problem.          08/31/00  Kozyr        OXYGEN           Update Needed      Units are ml/l, should be umol/kg          in the I9S/I8S and I1 .hy files oxygen is given in ml/l instead           umol/kg as it is in the rest of section and in WHPO manual           suggested.          09/26/00  Schlosser    TRITUM           No Data Submitted  Data not yet calibrated          Tritium data will be submitted later (after intercalibration).           We hold tritium data for a subset of our He lines only.           WHP lines with tritium:           S4P> S4I (East)> I8S> I9S> P9          09/27/00  Kappa        Cruise Report    Data UpDate        New PDF & TXT files completed          09/29/00  Huynh        Cruise Report    Website Updated:   pdf, txt versions online          02/07/01  Mantyla      NUTs/S/O         DQE Begun          Agreed to DQE Indian BTL data          I would be glad to look over the Indian Ocean data for you.           Sarilee has started plotting up I01 for me to start on. - Arnold          02/26/01  Schlosser    HELIUM/DELHE3    Data are Public    minor corrections may be needed          Following up on Bill Jenkins's message, I would like to ask you to           make public all ldeo woce tritium/he data that have been submitted           to you.  Because the tritium/he community has not yet finished the           final calibration of the data, I might have to apply minor           corrections to these data once the intercal.

They contain the same quality flag           problems that have been carried  through to the present.          I cannot find any record of a DQE. Jerry's hard copy book has a           message from you, dated Feb 6, 2001, to Arnold Mantyla requesting           he DQE all Indian Ocean WOCE cruises together with Arnold's response           saying he would be glad to do it and would start with I01. But the           book has no further reference to a DQE for I08S/I09S.          I will correct the problems you found and then recheck for any other problems.11/21/07  Jennings     NITRAT           Update Needed:     flag stn 60, 3358.4 dbar "-9"          There was a bubble in the nitrite flow cell which caused the high           absorbance reading (station 60, 3358.4 dbar value of 1.08). Since it           is an obvious problem, I'd replace the bad value with a -9.          03/24/08  Muus         DELC13/CFCs      Website Updated    Qual flag correctioins          Notes on changes to I08S-I09S_1994 20051213 bottle data files:             EXPOCODE 316N145_5                    1.
