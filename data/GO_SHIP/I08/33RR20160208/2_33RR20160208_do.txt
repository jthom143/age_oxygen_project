The survey of I08S consisted of *CTDO*,rosette, *LADCP*, chipod, water samples and underway measurements. Theship departed and returned to the port of Fremantle, WesternAustralia.A total of 83 stations were occupied with 2 CTDO/rosette/LADCP/chipodpackages and the vertical sampling section profiles can be seen in thefollowing two figures Figure: Sample Profile Section: Stations 1-45and Figure: Sample Section Profile: Stations 45-83. 1 test station and83 stations performed, for the most part, a reoccupation of I08S-2007.Stations 1-13 were completed with the initial primary package. Whiledeploying the package on station 14, our primary instrument was lost.A second package was used from stations 14-83.Fig. 1.2: Figure: *Sample Profile Section: Stations 1-45*Fig. 1.3: Figure: *Sample Section Profile: Stations 45-83*CTDO data and water samples were collected on each CTDO, rosette,LADCP and chipod cast, usually within 10 meters of the bottom. Watersamples were measured on board for salinity, dissolved oxygen,nutrients, *DIC*, pH, total alkalinity and *CFCs*/*SF6*. Additionalwater samples were collected and stored for shore analyses of δO^18,δN^15 and δO^18 in NO3, *DOC*/*TDN*, 13C/14C, *CDOM*, phytoplanktonpigments, *POC*, *HPLC* and *AP*.1.1  Programs and Principal InvestigatorsA sea-going science team assembled from 13 different institutions participated in the collection and analysis of this data set. Theprograms, affiliations, science team, responsibilities,instrumentation, analysis and analytical methods are outlined in thefollowing cruise documents.Program                  | Affiliation |

PackageCTDO/rosette/LADCP/chipod casts were performed with a packageconsisting of a 36 bottle rosette frame, a 36-place carousel and 36Bullister style bottles with an absolute volume of 10.4L. Underwaterelectronic components primarily consisted of a SeaBird Electronicspressure sensor and housing unit with dual exhaust, dual pumps, dualtemperature, a reference temperature, dual conductivity, dissolvedoxygen, transmissometer, chlorophyll fluorometer and altimeter. TheRINKOII optode, CDOM fluorometer and turbidity sensor were unique non-standard instruments that were not replaceable after loss of initialrosette package. LADCP and chipods instruments were deployed with theCTD/rosette package in most cases and their use is outlined insections of this document specific to their analysis.Equipment        | Model      | S/N          | Cal Date     | Sta   | Resp Party  =================+============+==============+==============+=======+=============Rosette          | 36-place   | Orange       |      -

Both cageswere mounted to one side of the bottom of the rosette frame. Thetemperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, respective pumps andexhaust tubing were mounted to the CTD housing as recommended by SBE.The reference temperature sensor was mounted between the primary andsecondary temperature sensors at the same level as the intake tubesfor the exhaust lines. The transmissometers were mounted horizontally.The fluorometers and altimeters were mounted vertically inside thebottom ring of the rosette frames. The 300 KHz bi-directionalBroadband LADCP (RDI) units, when in use, were mounted vertically onthe top and bottom sides of the frame. The LADCP battery pack was alsomounted on the bottom of the frame.The rosette system was suspended from a UNOLS-standard three-conductor0.322" electro-mechanical sea cable. The sea cable was terminated atthe beginning of I08S-2016. A full re-termination was completed afterthe package was replaced on station 14. Another full re-terminationwas performed prior to station 59. The CAST6 aft winch deploymentsystem cast used for test, 1-13 and 38-83 stations. The Markey DESH-5forward winch was used for stations 14-37.The deck watch prepared the rosette 10-30 minutes prior to each cast.The bottles were cocked and all valves, vents and lanyards werechecked for proper orientation. LADCP technician would check for LADCPbattery charge, prepare instrument for data acquisition and disconnectcables. The chipod battery was monitored for charge and connectorswere checked for fouling and connectivity. Every 20 stations, thetransmissometer windows were cleaned and an on deck blocked and un-blocked voltage readings were recorded prior to the cast. Once stoppedon station, the Marine Technician would check the sea state prior tocast and decide if conditions were acceptable for deployment.Recovering the package at the end of the deployment was essentiallythe reverse of launching. The rosette, CTD and carousel were rinsedwith fresh water frequently. CTD maintenance included rinsing de-ionized water through both plumbed sensor lines between casts. Onaverage, once every 20 stations, 1% Triton-x solution was also rinsedthrough both conductivity sensors. The rosette was routinely examinedfor valves and o-rings leaks, which were maintained as needed.2  CRUISE NARRATIVE2.1  SummaryA hydrographic survey in the southern Indian Ocean that includedCTD/rosette/LADCP/Chi-pods/ Fluorometer/Transmissometer casts and bio-optical casts, underway shipboard ADCP and pCO_2/T/S/XX/YYmeasurements, as well as SOCCOM biochemical floats and drifterdeployments were carried out between early February and mid-March 2016.After MOB (February 4th – 8th), the R/V Revelle departed Fremantle,Australia on February 8th at 16:06 (local). The southern end of theoccupation took a western route to avoid ice. Sampling began onFebruary 19th on the Antarctica shelf in less than 500 m of water.After leaving the shelf, sampling continued generally northeastwarduntil reaching 82°E where it began following the track of the 2007occupation. At station 14 the primary rosette and all associatedinstrumentation was lost. The spare rosette and instrumentreplacements were used the remainder of the line.A total of 83 stations were occupied: 83 CTD/rosette/fluorometer/transmissometer casts; 13 included both upward and downward looking LADCP and 56 included downward looking-only LADCP; 66 included two upward looking chi-pods, 9 included two downward looking chi-pods and 53 included 1 downward looking chi-pod; and 13 included a second fluorometer with a backscatter sensor. With a couple of exceptions, casts were made to within 10-15 m of the bottom. Water samples (up to 36) were collected in 10 L Bullister bottles at all stations pro-viding water samples for CFCs/SF6, Total DIC, Total Alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, salinity, DOC, DI^13/14C, DO^14C, CDOM, Chl-A, HPLC, AP, POC, δ^18O, and Nitrate δ^15N/δ^18O. Once a day when weather, sea state and satellite flyovers were conducive to sampling a spectro-radiometer cast was performed. Underway surface pCO2, tem-perature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, multi-beam bathymetry and meteorological measurements were collected. Six bio-chemical floats were deployed for the SOCCOM program and 10 surface drifters for the Global Drifter Program. XBTs provided upper water column temperature profiles for calibration of the multi-beam on all days that CTD casts were not performed. The cruise ended in Fremantle, Australia on March 16th, 2016 with deMOB occurring on March 17th.2.2  CRUISE NARRATIVEFollowing the tracks of the WOCE 1994 and CLIVAR 2007 occupations,2016 GO-SHIP expedition marks the third complete repeat of the IO8Stransect from Antarctica to 28°S. It is first leg of I08S/I09N 95°Emeridional transect in the Indian Ocean. The R/V Revelle arrived inFremantle on 3 February having completed a suite of successful testsof the CAST-6 (primary) and DESH-5 (backup) winches in mid-January.Between 4 February and 8 February, vans (SIO/ODF storage van, workingAOML/DICE van), equipment and supplies were loaded onto the ship inFremantle.On 8 February, before leaving port, R. Rupan (U.W.) provided atutorial on the instrumentation on and deployment of the SOCCOM(http://soccom.princeton.edu/) floats that we would be deploying. OurCTD-watchstander, Earle Wilson was in charge of SOCCOM floats as wellas writing a blog for the SOCCOM program outreach(http://floatdispenser.blogspot.com/). Trained by A. Pickering whilein port, watchstander Hannah Dawson was in charge of running the chi-pods for the non-sailing OSU group. With all hands on board at 14:00,Josh Manger (res-tech) provided an extended safety brief and Mary Huey(computer tech) gave us the basics of computer and Internet access onthe ship. With ODF busy setting up the data management for the cruiseand creating cheat sheets for the CTD-watch, the electronic web-basedevent logger was started for RR1603 and the various different types ofcasts and event were created for the cruise. The first event was thedeparture of the Revelle from a sunny and hot (106°F) Fremantle at16:06 with 28 scientists from 13 different institutions aboard,representing some XX PIs from YY institutions.Underway sampling of (pCO2, oxygen, nutrients and chlorophyll-A, XX)began at 20:00 local (12:00 UTC) and continued every 4 hoursthereafter. In spite of rain overnight, the following day (Tuesday 9February) turned out to be sunny, if somewhat bumpy (seas 4-6 ft, with6-8 swell and wind at 22 kt). The time for the test cast wasdetermined. We wanted at least 3000 m of water, to be outside theAustralian EEZ and to have it occur during the middle of the day. CTD-watch was tutored on console duties and the rosette. We had our firstdrills and obtained our first of our XBT profile. XBT profiles weretaken every day while in transit to update the sound speed profileused by the multi-beam. Anyone who wanted the experience could sign upto deploy an XBT.The test cast took place on 10 February at 10:00. There was a hitch atthe start with a miscommunication between computer and the winch. Thecomputer’s coms check was interpreted as a signal that lab was ready,but it was not. Deck could individually hear and speak to the winch,but there was no direct communication between lab and deck; a pointthat was not understood at the start of the cast. On later stations,the Computer Lab often had a radio on in the lab to help mitigate thisissue. The first time the rosette went into the water, there were nonumbers coming out the CTD. Once this was finally relayed to deck therosette was brought out, by which time the CTD had started takereadings. It was deployed a second time. The test cast proceeded withno further issues. Once complete, the CDOM group deployed the spectro-radiometer, and sampling at the rosette began. The CTD-watchstanderswere taught to sample-cop and to sample for TAlk and salts.The following day as winds picked up it became obvious that a cold/fluhad come aboard with us. The combination of strong winds with 8-12 ftseas and flu symptoms continued for at least a week - making ourtransit of the Southern Ocean difficult. Nevertheless, for the mostpart, spirits remained high with cribbage games and birthdaycelebrations coming in a seemingly endless stream. Two of the CTD-watchstanders (Seth Travis and Natalie Freeman) created a handy pieceof software that would allow us to track our position on the weatherforecast maps.Fig. 2.1: Maps          Example of the weather maps used on the cruise from 21 February          2016 15:00 UTC. Wind map for the Southern Indian Ocean from          passageweather.com overlaid with our position at the time the          figure as made (red diamond); our first station (yellow star); the          track prior to the forecast date (black line); our planned position          at the time of the forecast (gray diamond). (S. Travis and N.          Freeman)We were grateful to see that in spite of the sea state we wereexperiencing, we were missing the worst of the storm. Although it tooksome of the science party the entire transit to get their sea legs, wewere treated to science talks by many of the participants and we allmanaged to be on our feet for the first station.To create a sequential line from Antarctica to the northern Bay ofBengal we began the 2016 I08S line at the southern end. The intentionwas to follow track of the 2007 repeat as closely as possible.Therefore, initially we steamed directly southwest towards what hadbeen the 2007 station 10 at 63.525°S, 82.000°E. This would place usmidway between the 2007 shelf stations and our best guess at a 2016ice-free route onto the shelf. S. Escher at SIO provided us with dailyupdates on ice conditions in the form of ice concentration maps basedon data from NSIDC averaged over 0.5°x0.5° bins.Fig. 2.2: Ice-Concentration          Example of the ice maps used on the cruise. Color shading indicates          ice-concentration from NSIDC. Both the 2007 and planned 2016 tracks          are plotted along with presently floats in the region. (Courtesy of          S. Escher)Andrew Constable onboard the Aurora Australis (currently in the regionperforming their K-AXIS observations) also provided us (via SteveRintoul) with hand-annotated maps of the ice-conditions they wereseeing. It was obvious before reaching our first waypoint that inspite of some melting and shifting, the 2007 shelf stations were underice. Therefore, we chose to sample the shelf to the west of the 2007line. Under the expert navigational advice of Captain Curl weapproached the shelf from the west. There was some risk in thisdecision in that we would need extra time this approach and track thatwould have to be made up by efficient sampling and steaming as well asthe possibility of some extension of the nominal GO-SHIP 30 nm stationspacing for later stations. Nevertheless, it was considered importantto get the shelf stations, particularly because of the other workgoing on in the region (K-AXIS) and decisions concerning spacing wereleft for the future when we would have a better handle on stationtiming.As we headed south we were treated to displays of the Southern Lights,Aurora Australis. A sign up list for aurora wake up calls was startedso that no one would have to miss what for some of us was a once in alife time opportunity to see the spectacle. On February 19th, 11 daysafter leaving Fremantle, approaching from the west to avoid ice, wereached our first station at 66.6°S, 78.4°E in Prydz Bay. Toeveryone’s delight we were just south of the Antarctic Circle at thetime was at 66.5°S. In ~460 m of water station 001/01 occurred withoutincident.Our track took us on a line perpendicular to the slope, northwestwardfrom our first station on the shelf to station 007 at 66.15°S,78.01°E. The close station spacing (3.2 to 9.4 nm) provided bottomdepth changes between stations of order 500 m. We then began a seriesof stations approximately 37-38 nm apart to bring us around theregions of high ice-concentration back to the northward track of the2007 line at 82°E. Although always kept at a safe distance, we wereaccompanied by isolated icebergs as we sampled our way across thePrincess Elizabeth Trough. At more than one point we had to change ourtransit heading to avoid ice, and once we had to shift a stationposition because an iceberg had arrived there before us. Nevertheless,the ice-concentration maps were a great help because we only traveledthrough regions with less than 10% ice-cover giving us plenty of spaceand time to stay well away from the potential ice hazards.Occasionally, sightings were reported of penguins sitting en masse onthese bergs. However, not even the many zoom lenses carried with usmanaged to actually capture these penguineries. We were, however, metby the occasional penguin or two in the water, along with whales,albatross and petrels all of which were subject to our cameras, phonesand Go-Pros. In fact, very little occurred on this cruise that was notsubject to one or more forms of image capture.We proceeded to work our way through stations ironing out short-termsurmountable issues. At station 2, the solution in the syringes placedon the CTD intake froze. It was decided that until temperatures warmedup we would rinse the CTD with the syringes and then remove them. Itwas found that for stations 001-003 although conductivity was correct,there was a problem with the conversion to salinity. A softwaresolution was found. Another issue that followed us throughout thecruise was the source of seawater intake. During our transit, theuncontaminated seawater intake was switched from the bow to theportside sea chest because the rough weather was causing bubbles.However, on Feb 19th, trash was found in the uncontaminated seawater.It was therefore requested that trash not be dump on the portside.Later in the cruise, when the weather calmed, intake was switched backto the bow, and switched back and forth yet again as the weatherchanged and when a problem with the sea chest pump occurred. Onstation 005 the wire stopped paying out at 1368 m. Evidently a surgefrom the generator caused the ship to have to shut down power. Thepower came back after a few minutes and the cast continued withoutfurther incident. The multi-beam began having difficulties before evenarriving at our southernmost point, at the start of station 006 itwas shut down for maintenance. Luckily our altimeter was workingflawlessly coming in 200 m above the bottom.By the time we reached station 010 it was obvious that particularlywith short station spacing coming off the shelf, the day shift CTDwatch was being overwhelmed by the extra sampling for non-sailingparticipants that included both δ^18O and Nitrate δ^15N/δ^18O. Thewatchstander students were also sampling salts and TAlk, and Hannahwas in charge of the chi-pods downloads and maintenance. It wastherefore, decided that the δ^18O and Nitrate δ^15N/δ^18O samplingwould only occur on the night shift which had 3 watchstander students.On the night watch, Natalie Freeman and David Webb also helped withthe radiocarbon sampling.To stagger the bottle spacing throughout the water column and acrossstations we used three rotating schema designed for a 36 bottlerosette. The particular pressures at which bottles would be trippedwere based on bottom depth and scheme. To alleviate the pressure onthe analysis teams it was decided that when in shallower waters (lessthan 3000 meters) and particularly during times of close stationspacing the number of bottles to be tripped would be pre-determined.The schema would still be used, but in such a way that the pressuresat which samples were taken were set by the number of bottles to betripped rather than the bottom depth. To keep some consistency, whenstations positions matched, the number of bottles used in 2007 wouldbe considered in this decision.Stations 007 to 0010 had taken us eastward across deepest stations inthe Princess Elizabeth Trough and we began to head up the slopesoutheast of the Banzare Bank (part of the larger Kerguelen Plateau).On 21 February, at station 011 (82°E) we arrived back at the 2007line. We reverted back to our nominal 30 nm spacing and we had ourfirst SOCCOM float deployment. These deployments were done inconjunction with extra sampling for HPLC and POC from the rosette atthe chlorophyll-A maximum and at the surface. At one of these twodepths we would trip two bottles, so that duplicates of the 2.2L HPLCand POC samples could be taken. As it turned out, it was only at theother depth (where only 1 bottle was tripped) that we ran into issueswith water availability. At all subsequent casts where these sampleswere taken we either tripped two bottles at both the surface andchlorophyll maximum, or made sure that HPLC/POC and nutrients obtainedwater before salts and any non-level 1 sampling. The float deploymentsare discussed in a separate section of this report.During our first few days of sampling we had overcome the expectedvariety of small issues as they had come up, and with the now longerstation spacing, we were just getting into the swing of deployments,recoveries, sampling and analysis when we came to station 014 (62.0°S,82.0°E) just after lunch on 22 February. All appeared to be goingwell, the CAST-6 boom had extended out over the water for deploymentjust as it had done on every other cast when the CTD package wasunceremoniously dumped into 2250 m of water.Fig. 2.3: Rosette loss          The primary rosette going in for the last time on station 014           Cast 01 (photo courtesy of M.

Calls to shore were made and a decision was quickly reached not to drag for the lost rosette along with all our primary instrumentation as a) there would be too much time lost with little hope of recovery and b) setting up dragging would involve the same personnel needed to prep the spare CTD/rosette and the hydro-boom, DESH-5 winch.Along with ODF/STS and the day shift science personnel who got thereplacement rosette together quickly and efficiently, the ship crewdid a wonderful job getting us up and running again. The teamworkinvolved on what was a very cold in the Southern Ocean wasoutstanding. This efficiency and the subsequent fast transit speedsgave us as much time as possible to make up for the loss and trulyminimized the overall impact on science. The chief and co-chief wantto personally thank everyone involved, and my particular thanks go toCaptain Chris Curl, Res-tech Josh Manger, Techs John Calderwood andSusan Becker who kept the whole situation in perspective and motivateda positive solution, and to science personnel Hannah Dawson, SethTravis, Maverick Cary and Phil Mele who did whatever was asked of themto assist. Surprisingly, there were some bonuses to this disaster.These included a) the chance for the day watch students to not onlysee how a rosette is put together, but actually help in the buildingof it; b) the reversion back to the DESH-5 gave all the students achance to participate in deck work; and c) keeping our sense of humorhere, it provided the chief and co-chief scientists the chance to firea few bottles and gave a number of the other members of the scienceparty a chance to work at the console or on the deck. Within less than9 hours we were up and running again. Generally speaking, every 4hours of time lost is equivalent to losing one 4000 m station. Loss ofstations means a loss of horizontal resolution which was particularlyimportant to us for resolving the ACC fronts and eddy field to thenorth of the Kerguelen Plateau.At station 014, the first with our new rosette, we double fired allbottles to check for problems. Not wishing to lose any more time, wecontinued up the slope and onto station 015. We continued to deal withsmall issues with the Bullister bottles that meant we lost some datato misfires and leaks. We continued to double fire at depths where wewere using “untrustworthy” bottles. As we were in fairly shallow waters (<2200 m) we had bottles to spare for this process of working out thekinks. One loss over these days was that we did not yet have eitherour remaining LADCP or 3 chi-pods installed. Both had to wait for theengineers to design additions to the rosette frame for mounting of theinstruments and batteries.Station 015 also presented another issue that plagued us as long as weused the DESH-5. The winch was unable to properly zero out the meter.Initially this just created offset headaches for the consoleoperators, but eventually, after a number of attempts to fix theproblem, the inability to zero correctly escalated to a software“feature” that required the winch to zero out the meter before 1400 mof wire-out; otherwise it would revert to negative 1400 and startcounting backwards. So, beginning at station 028, every one-thousandmeters the console would give the winch a heads up and the meter would be zeroed out on the fly. Interestingly this actually made the consoleoperators job easier because they only had to deal with the last 3digits on the offset between wire-out and pressure.On the 23 February at station 19 we deployed the first of 10 surfacedrifters for the Global Drifter Program at approximate 59.5°S, 82°E.Over the course of the cruise most of the CTD watch had a chance todeploy a drifter or two as it basically entailed nothing more thandropping them off the back of the ship and noting the time andposition.We maintained 30 nm spacing or better between 63°S and 54°S and thestations once again began to roll by as we crossed the KerguelenPlateau and over the sharp ridge on the northern side into the LabuanBasin, home to our deepest casts. The chi-pods (2 upward and 1downward) and LADCP (downward only) went on the rosette at station028. The replacement LADCP appeared to have issues with the tilt ofthe rosette, but nothing could be done about this as there did notseem to be any way to re-weight the rosette or to re-seat the LADCPsystem. These problems continued until the incident at station 59 –but more about that later.By the time we reached station 032 (54.9°S, 86.6°E) the winds hadpicked up again and we were reminded that we were once again crossingthe Southern Ocean. By station 033, we decided to start firing bottleson the fly to minimize the amount of the time in the water. At station034 the winch was forced not to exceed 30 m/min to avoid hightensions, and after a long delay due to strong winds, much of the downcast for station 35 (4600 m) was done at 10 m/min. Still wepersevered. At station 36, unidentified noises started coming from thewinch, which stopped at 4370 m wire-out for some investigation. Thestation continued, but on the next (037) the DESH-5 seized. Aftergoing down at 30 m/min due to tension spikes, the console was informedof mechanical issues and the cast was stopped at 2010 m wire-out. Therosette was brought up at 4 m/min and bottles were fired on the fly.The internals of the DESH-5 system had seized and it was not possiblecorrect the issue at sea. Everyone was left somewhat mystified at allthese winch issues as both the CAST-6 and DESH-5 had been completelyoverhauled just prior to the start of this cruise. Nevertheless, oursis not to reason why. Ours is to figure out what to do and get back tosampling. We moved off station 037 with only half a profile and movedon to the station 038.On the transit and once on station the CAST-6 winch was once againprepared for use and the wire was re-terminated. As we no longer had arosette with a frame designed for docking, our chief engineer, theres- techs and winch operators worked out a way to use the CAST-6 as aboom. Tests were performed with a weight and the rosette so thatbetween them winch operators and deck would have control of thepackage. It was decided that a third person would be needed to providean extra tagline. It was also found that with this new setup negativetensions on the downcast could be an issue when the ship rolled, so itbecame common practice to start descent at 30 m/min, move on to 45m/min and then only once the package was 200-500 m deep accelerate to60 m/min. Station 038 proceeded without major incidents, but the levelwind failed somewhere near the bottom. Since the engineers were notconfident enough with the system to re-lay the wire with the rosetteon it, we stopped at a point between stations 038 and 039 that wasdeeper than 038, put a weight on the wire and sent it down to belowthe point that level wind had failed. With the wire wound onto thespool correctly we continued on to station 039.At 53.5°S we went to 35 nm spacing, a compromise between the need tomake up time and the desire to have closer station in the rich eddyfield created by the Polar Front as it passes to the north ofKerguelen and Heard Islands and the plateau. Before even arriving atthis region, our co-chief, Vivianne Menezes was creating mean fieldsof these eddies along with one day a real-time image.Fig. 2.4: Real-time image          Satellite sea surface anomaly and absolute geostrophic currents for          Feb 24, 2016 (stations 021-026) based on near real-time altimetry          data from IMOS. Pink squares show the I08S station positions.  (V.          Menezes)This region, and in particular, the pathway of the Polar Front aresubjects of CTD-watchstander Natalie Freemans thesis research. Sheprovided us with maps of mean frontal position (~station 034) and wehope to see real time figures once we get back to shore. Being in theSouthern Ocean has the big disadvantage that our Internet bandwidth islow, making real-time anything difficult to obtain. One exception isweather. Our LADCP tech, Phil Mele, directed us to a website where wecould download small (kbyte) 3-hour forecasts of winds and waves(Passageweather.com/download.htm). It was these maps that Seth Travisoverlaid our track on, and these maps that kept us diligently movingnorthward as we worked to avoid a massive storm that would have causedeven more delays.At stations 039 and 040 we again had some issues with wire readout. Wenow found that the numbers in the lab were not the same as those seen bythe winch. It was a initially thought that this particular problemcould be fixed by a software reset, but to varying extents itcontinued throughout the rest of the cruise. As it got too confusing,it helped when the winch used LCI readout that lab could also see.Likewise, there were occasional glitches when winch’s wire-out readoutwould fail completely. There was one other winch “feature” that beganoccurring regularly which was that on descent the winch would have tostop in order to slow down. This meant that console had to beparticularly diligent in being early to give the slow down signal forthe bottom approach.At station 41 with 1.5 knots of current under us, and a lot of wireout, we had the ship go off station to correct the problem. But, aswe headed northward out of the Furious Fifties into the RoaringForties for the most part the casts went by uneventfully and we beganto make up time as deck and winch grew more skillful with deploymentsand recoveries. Air tests were performed on the secondarytransmissometer on stations 14, 37, 57 and 78. The computer runningthe Seabird software, which had been rebooted at station 020 (2/23)when dealing with an issue with the computer mouse, had to be rebootedagain at station 049 (3/3) after it froze near the surface on theascent. This same freezing up of the console occurred at station 077(3/10). We would suggest that in the future the computer be rebootedevery day to avoid the issue.On March 4, after station 054, the hangar was found to be slippery. Wetried to clean it up but could not alleviate the problem, which onlyappeared to be getting worse. Once daylight was with us the engineersdetermined that it was a leak from a loose fitting on the CAST-6hydraulics on the deck above. Both DOC and CDOM were carefully toclean all spigots before sampling. The crew to get the deck and hangarcleaned up.In the first week of March as we moved into warmer climes the hydro-labbegan having issues with rising temperatures. On 5 March the shipturned the air conditioning back on and appeared to have solved theissue. It certainly cooled off the computer lab.On March 6th, by station 058 the wire was beginning to look damaged –showing small curve and raised strand outer armor. Using an abundanceof caution as requested from land, the wire was mechanicallyreterminated. On station 059 recovery the Evergrip used in thetermination slipped, the packaged slid down the wire hitting theboards and then teetering on the rail as the winch attempted to bringit in. It was brought under control and brought onboard. The studentson the deck did a great job of holding the lines and the winch managedto pick it up and get it safely on the deck. A complete reterminationwas done before Station 60. Not only did all sensors check out afterthis incident, but the LADCP actually started working properly again.Also, this time it was night watchstanders who got the chance to learnabout and participate in a retermination. We consider ourselves luckyas the glass salinity sensors could have easily broken and the two westill had available were not as good as those on the rosette.We had started doing 40 nm spacing at station 051 (45.6°S),but the efficiency of the work as we continued using the CAST-6system meant that we were making up time, allowing us to revert backto the 30 nm spacing or less until station 078. The captain gave us adrop-dead time of 06:00 (local) on 12 March for completing our finalstation. We finished up the last few subtropical casts using 36 nmspacing, making it through our final planned station at 28.3°S with 25minutes to spare. The one loss on these few days of sampling was forCFCs, whose system broke down due to an overflow. Nevertheless, theygot it up and running again and were able to fully sample the last fewstations.During our copious free time, along with maps of tracks and bottlespacing, we started to produce section plots. These indicate strongCFC and SF6 signals in bottom and intermediate waters (see sectionplots). We also began some preliminary comparisons to the previousoccupations of this line. Consistent with large-scale studies, thereare strong warming and freshening signals visible in the bottomwaters.Fig. 2.5: Property-Property          Potential Temperature versus Salinity plot comparing data from the          previous two occupations of I08s to the 2016 occupation. The data          indicate strong warming and freshening between 63°S and 51°S          (contours σ4).Our co-chief, Viviane Menezes put a substantial effort into apreliminary analysis of the temperature and salinity changes and wehope to have these results in the published literature soon.As this report is being written we are in the midst of the 4–daytransit back to Fremantle. Yesterday we had red-nose testing for thosefor whom this was the first Antarctic Circle crossing. In full penguinregalia the red-noses cleaned the refrigerators and galley, and madepizzas for lunch. Two penguins deployed XBTS and all penguins joinedin a rousing rendition of the hit song, ICEBERG, written and arrangedby our very own res-tech Josh Manger. By unanimous vote of a two-person panel the winning penguin was declared to be Mary Huey, a rock-hopper with pink feet and a uniquely slippery coat.Along with writing documentation, we are once again deploying XBTseach day and will be doing some rearrangements of the lab spaces somake room for the new groups arriving with I9N. We are expecting toarrive outside Fremantle on the evening of the 15th, which shouldallow us to start unloading on 16 March as intended.This cruise presented us all with challenges. We would like thank theofficers and crew of the R/V Revelle who have gone above and beyond tosupport the science of this expedition. They have worked with us everystep of the way, to fix everything from the smallest detail to thegreatest problems, all the while speeding us along so that we couldsample the full line with minimal loss of data.3  CTDO AND HYDROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS3.1  CTDO and Bottle Data AcquisitionThe CTD data acquisition system consisted of an SBE-11+ (V2) deck unitand a networked generic PC workstation running Windows 7 2009 SBESeaSave v.7.18c software was used for data acquisition and to closebottles on the rosette.CTD deployments were initiated by the console watch after the ship hadstopped on station. The watch maintained a CTD Cast logs for eachattempted cast containing a description of each deployment event.Once the deck watch had deployed the rosette, the winch operator wouldlower it to 10 meters. The CTD exhaust line pumps were configured witha 10 second startup delay in addition to the necessity that salt waterbe present in the conductivity cells, and were usually on by thistime. The console operator checked the CTD data for proper sensoroperation, waited for sensors to stabilize, and then instructed thewinch operator to bring the package to the surface in good weather andup to 5 meters below the surface in high seas. The winch was theninstructed to lower the package to the initial target wire-out at nomore than 30m/min to 100m and no more than 60m/min after 100mdepending on sea cable tension and the sea state.The console watch monitored the progress of the deployment and qualityof the CTD data through interactive graphics and operational displays.The altimeter channel, CTD pressure, wire-out and center multibeamdepth were all monitored to determine the distance of the package fromthe bottom. The winch was directed to slow decent rate to 30m/min 100mfrom the bottom and 10m/min 30m from the bottom. The maximum depth ofthe CTD cast was usually within 10-20 meters of the bottom depthdetermined by the altimeter data. For each up-cast, the winch operatorwas directed to stop the winch at up to 36 predetermined samplingpressures. These standard depths were staggered every station using 3sampling schemes. The CTD console operator waited 30 seconds prior totripping sample bottles, to ensure package shed-wake had dissipated.An additional 15 seconds elapsed before moving to the next consecutivetrip depth, which allowed for the SBE35RT to record bottle triptemperature.After the last bottle was closed, the console operator directed winchto recover the rosette. Once the rosette was on deck, the consoleoperator terminated the data acquisition, turned off the deck unit andassisted with rosette sampling.Additionally, the watch created a sample log for each deployment.Sample logs are used to record the depths of bottles tripped and serveas correspondence between rosette bottles and analytical samplesdrawn.Normally the CTD sensors were rinsed after each station using syringesfitted with Tygon tubing and filled with a fresh solution of diluteTriton-X in de-ionized water. The syringes were left on the CTDbetween casts, with the temperature and conductivity sensors immersedin the rinsing solution.Each bottle on the rosette had a unique serial number, independent ofthe bottle position on the rosette. Sampling for specific programs wasoutlined on sample log sheets prior to cast recovery or at the time ofcollection. The bottles and rosette were examined before samples weredrawn. Any abnormalities were noted on the sample log, stored in thecruise database and reported in the APPENDIX.3.2  CTDO Data ProcessingShipboard CTD data processing was performed after deployment usingSIO/ODF CTD processing software v.5.1.0. CTD acquisition data werecopied onto the Linux system and database, then processed to a0.5-second time-series. CTD data at bottle trips were extracted, and a2-decibar down-cast pressure series created. The pressure series dataset was submitted for CTD data distribution.A total of 88 CTD casts were made including one test cast, 4 abortedcasts and 83 successful CTD casts. The 36-place (CTD #401) rosette wasused on the test station 998 and from station 1 to station 13. The36-place (CTD #831) rosette was used from station 14 to station 83CTD data were examined at the completion of each deployment for cleancorrected sensor response and any calibration shifts. As bottlesalinity and oxygen results became available they were used to refineshipboard conductivity and oxygen sensor calibrations.Temperature, salinity and dissolved O2 comparisons were made betweendown and up casts as well as between groups of adjacent deployments.Vertical sections of measured and derived properties from sensor datawere checked for consistency.A number of issues were encountered during I08S-2016 that directlyimpacted CTD analysis. Low surface air temperatures caused total iceblockage in primary plumb line of CTD on station/cast 2/2.Station/cast 2/2 was terminated to clear plumb lines and the stationwork resumed with 2/3. A similar partial ice blockage occurred onstation 4/1 and cleared a few hundred meters from the surface. Theloss of our primary rosette system (CTD #401) occurred during recoveryof the package on station 14. Deployments resumed from the MarkeyDESH-5 winch deployment system after a back-up package (CTD #831)could be constructed on station 14. The LCI-90i interface and DESH-5system  was used from station 14-38 and that system had communicationissues as well as possible drum slip issues on station/cast 038/01 at4450-4470 dbar. The cast 038/01 was paused to analyze the LCI-90 andDESH-5 communications, which compromised the stability of the CTDOsignal and that section of data was coded questionable. Winch stops onCTDO down-cast were also noted on several stations where the CAST6system was put back into use. The CAST6 system was frequently stoppedbetween on bottom approach from 60m/min to 30 m/min transition to putthe automated control into manual mode. Only station 059/01 from3530-3590 and station 065/02 from 4000-4040 appeared to havecompromised data sections due to the auto manual transition, and thosesections were also coded questionable. One station had a sizablesignal inversion in oxygen and conductivity from 2350 to 2390 dbar.The inversion was filtered and coded on the data as well. High seasand negative winch tensions during operations prompted CTD acquisitionteam to trip bottles without the standard delay observed at triplevels ("tripping on the fly") on the up-cast for stations 33-37. Triplevels that appeared to be negatively impacted by "tripping on thefly" were quality flagged and recorded in APPENDIX.3.3  Pressure AnalysisLaboratory calibrations of CTD pressure sensors were performed priorto the cruise. Dates of laboratory calibration are recorded on theunderway sampling package table and calibration documents are providedin the APPENDIX.The Paroscientific Digiquartz pressure transducer S/N: 401-59916 andS/N: 831-99677 were both calibrated on November 17th, 2015 at the SIO/Calibration Facility. The lab calibration coefficients provided on thereport were used to convert frequencies to pressure. Initially SIO/pressure lab calibration slope and offsets coefficients were appliedto cast data. A shipboard calibration offset was applied to thepressure signal during each cast. These offsets were determined by theon-deck pre- and post-cast pressure offsets. The pressure offsets wereapplied per configuration cast sets.* CTD Serial 401-59916; Station Set 1-13               | Start P (dbar) | End P (dbar)==============================================Min            | -0.2           | -0.3      ---------------+----------------+-------------Max            |  2.5           | -0.1      ---------------+----------------+-------------Average        |  0.164286      | -0.214286 ---------------+----------------+-------------Applied Offset |                | -0.06     CTD Serial 831-99677; Station Set 14-83               | Start P (dbar) | End P (dbar)==============================================Min            | -0.5           | -0.5      ---------------+----------------+-------------Max            |  0.3           |  0.5      ---------------+----------------+-------------Average        | -0.0695652     | -0.114493 ---------------+----------------+-------------Applied Offset |                |  0.1      Pre- and post-cast on-deck pressure offsets for CTD 401 varied from-0.2 to +2.5 dbar before the casts, and -0.3 to -0.1 dbar after thecasts. An offset of -0.06 was applied to every cast performed by CTD401. Pre- and post-cast on-deck pressure offsets for CTD 831 variedfrom -0.5 to +0.3 dbar before the casts, and -0.5 to +0.5 dbar afterthe casts. An offset of 0.1 was applied to every cast performed byCTD 831.3.4  Temperature AnalysisLaboratory calibrations of temperature sensors were performed prior tothe cruise at the SIO/ Calibration Facility. Dates of laboratorycalibration are recorded on the 'Underway Sampling Package' table andcalibration documents are provided in the APPENDIX.The pre-cruise laboratory calibration coefficients were used toconvert SBE3plus frequencies to 90 temperature. Additional shipboardcalibrations were performed to correct sensor bias. Two independentmetrics of calibration accuracy were used to determine sensor bias. Ateach bottle closure, the primary and secondary temperature werecompared with each other and with a SBE35RT reference temperaturesensor.The SBE35RT Digital Reversing Thermometer is an internally-recordingtemperature sensor that operates independently of the CTD. The SBE35RTwas located equidistant between the two SBE3plus temperature sensors.It is triggered by the SBE32 carousel in response to a bottle closure.According to the manufacturer's specifications, the typical stabilityis 0.001(deC/year. The SBE35RT was set to internally average over a 5second period.A functioning SBE3plus sensor typically exhibit a consistentpredictable well modeled response. The response model is second orderwith respect to pressure, a first order with respect to temperatureand a first order with respect to time. The functions used to applyshipboard calibrations are as follows.              T    = T + D P  + D P  + D T  + D T + Offset               cor        1 2    2      3 2    4                             T   = T + tp P + t                             90         1     0                  T   = T + aP  + bP + cT  + dT + Offset                   90         2          2Corrected temperature differences are shown in figures SBE35RT-T1 bystation (-0.01°C  T1-T2  0.01°C) through T1-T2 by pressure (-0.01°CT1-T2  0.01°C).Fig. 3.1: SBE35RT-T1 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig. 3.2: Deep SBE35RT-T1 by station (Pressure ≥ 2000dbar).Fig. 3.3: SBE35RT-T2 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig. 3.4: Deep SBE35RT-T2 by station (Pressure ≥ 2000dbar).Fig. 3.5: T1-T2 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig. 3.6: Deep T1-T2 by station (Pressure ≥ 2000dbar).Fig. 3.7: SBE35RT-T1 by pressure (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig. 3.8: SBE35RT-T2 by pressure (-0.01° ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig. 3.9: T1-T2 by pressure (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).The 95% confidence limits for the mean low-gradient (where -0.01°C≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C) differences are ±0.0049°C for SBE35RT-T1, ±0.0052°C for SBE35RT-T2 and ±0.0042°Cfor T1-T2. The 95% confidence limits for the deep temperature residuals (where pressure ≥ 2000dbar) are ±0.00083°C for SBE35RT-T1, ±0.00096°C for SBE35RT-T2 and ±0.00088°C for T1-T2.No problems were encountered with the temperature sensors used for thiscruise. The SBE35RT memory bank was full for stations 75/1 bottle 36to station 78/1 bottle 21. Data was not reported from the SBE35RT forthat section.3.5  Conductivity AnalysisLaboratory calibrations of conductivity sensors were performed priorto the cruise at the SeaBird Calibration Facility. Dates of laboratorycalibrations are recorded on the underway sampling package table andcalibration documents are provided in the APPENDIX.The pre-cruise laboratory calibration coefficients were used toconvert SBE4C frequencies to mS/cm conductivity values. Additionalshipboard calibrations were performed to correct sensor bias.Corrections for both pressure and temperature sensors were finalizedbefore analyzing conductivity differences. Two independent metrics ofcalibration accuracy were examined. At each bottle closure, theprimary and secondary conductivity were compared with each other. Eachsensor was also compared to conductivity calculated from check samplesalinities using CTD pressure and temperature.The differences between primary and secondary temperature sensors wereused as filtering criteria to reduce the contamination of conductivitycomparisons by package wake. The coherence of this relationship isshown in the following figure.Fig 3.10: Coherence of conductivity differences as a function of          temperature differences.Uncorrected conductivity comparisons are shown in figures UncorrectedCBottle - C1 by station (-0.01°C  T1-T2  0.01°C). through UncorrectedC1-C2 by station (-0.01°C  T1-T2  0.01°C)..Fig 3.11: Uncorrected C(Bottle) - C1 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2          ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.12: Uncorrected C(Bottle) - C2 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2          ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.13: Uncorrected C1-C2 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).A functioning SBE4C sensor typically exhibit a predictable modeledresponse. Offsets for each C sensor were determined using C(Bottle) -C_CTD differences in a deeper pressure range (500 or more dbars).After conductivity offsets were applied to all casts, response topressure, temperature and conductivity were examined for eachconductivity sensor. The response model is second order with respectto pressure, a first order with respect to temperature, first orderwith respect to conductivity and a first order with respect to time.The functions used to apply shipboard calibrations are as follows.The residual conductivity differences after correction are shown infigures Corrected C(Bottle) - C1 by station (-0.01°C  T1-T2  0.01°C).through Corrected C1-C2 by conductivity (-0.01°C  T1-T2  0.01°C)..Fig 3.14: Corrected C(Bottle) - C1 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.15: Deep Corrected C(Bottle) - C1 by station (Pressure >= 2000dbar).Fig 3.16: Corrected C(Bottle) - C2 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.17: Deep Corrected C(Bottle) - C2 by station (Pressure >= 2000dbar).Fig 3.18: Corrected C1-C2 by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.19: Deep Corrected C1-C2 by station (Pressure >= 2000dbar).Fig 3.20: Corrected C(Bottle) - C1 by pressure (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.21: Corrected C(Bottle) - C2 by pressure (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.22: Corrected C1-C2 by pressure (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.23: Corrected C(Bottle) - C1 by conductivity (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.24: Corrected C(Bottle) - C2 by conductivity (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.25: Corrected C1-C2 by conductivity (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Corrections made to all conductivity sensors had the form:                               2                C    = C + cp P  + cp P + c C + c                 cor         2       1     1     0Salinity residuals after applying shipboard P/T/C corrections aresummarized in the following figures.

The95% confidence limits for the deep salinity residuals (where pressure≥ 2000dbar) are ±0.00016 for salinity-C1.A number of issues affected conductivity and calculated CTD salinitiesduring this cruise. After the loss of the initial package on station14 a new package was constructed with new instrumentation. Thesecondary conductivity (SBE4C: 42023) was used from station 14-56.C2:42023 was replaced after its data drifted at a non-linear ratethat was not in accordance with manufacturing specifications. As thecruise progressed North the temperatures in the Hydro-Lab, wherediscrete salinity samples were analyzed, became unstable. Samples datafrom station 48 bottle 2 through bottle 23 and station 49 bottle 1through bottle 29 were considered unusable for comparison.3.6  CTD Dissolved OxygenLaboratory calibrations of the dissolved oxygen sensors were performedprior to the cruise at the SeaBird Calibration Facility. Dates oflaboratory calibration are recorded on the underway sampling packagetable and calibration documents are provided in the APPENDIX.The pre-cruise laboratory calibration coefficients were used toconvert SBE43 frequencies to µmol/kg oxygen values for acquisitiononly. Additional shipboard fittings were performed to correct for thesensors non-linear response. Corrections for pressure, temperatureand conductivity sensors were finalized before analyzing dissolvedoxygen data. The SBE43 sensor data were compared to dissolved O2check samples taken at bottle stops by matching the down cast CTD datato the up cast trip locations along isopycnal surfaces. CTD dissolvedO2 was then calculated using Clark Cell MPOD O2 sensor responsemodel for Beckman/Sensormedics and SBE43 dissolved O2 sensors. Theresidual differences of bottle check value versus CTD dissolved O2values are minimized by optimizing the SIO DO sensor response modelcoefficients with a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squaresfitting procedure.The general form of the SIO DO sensor response model equation forClark cells follows Brown and Morrison [Mill82] and Owens [Owen85] SIOmodels DO sensor secondary responses with lagged CTD data. In-situpressure and temperature are filtered to match the sensor responses.Time constants for the pressure response (τp), a slow τTfand fast τT(s) thermal response, package velocity τ(dP),thermal diffusion τd(T) and pressure hysteresis τh are fittingparameters. Once determined for a given sensor, these time constantstypically remain constant for a cruise. The thermal diffusion term isderived by low-pass filtering the difference between the fast responseT(s) and slow response T(l) temperatures. This term is intended tocorrect non-linearities in sensor response introduced by inappropriateanalog thermal compensation. Package velocity is approximated by low-pass filtering 1st-order pressure differences, and is intended tocorrect flow-dependent response. Dissolved O2 concentration is thencalculated:        ´                  `       |           P(h)     |                                       dOc       dP       |       C(2)----     |            (C(4)t(s) + C(7)P(1) + C(6)--- + C(8)--- + C(9)dT)O2ml/l=|C·V  ·e    5000 + C |·ƒ   (T,P)·e                            dT       dTt       | 1 DO              3|  sat       |                    |        `                  ´Where:* O2 ml/l          Dissolved O2 concentration in ml/l* V(DO)            Raw sensor output* C(1)             Sensor slope* C(2)             Hysteresis response coefficient* C(3)             Sensor offset* f(sat) (T,P)|O2| saturation at T,P (ml/l)* T                In-situ temperature (°C)* P                In-situ pressure (decibars)* P(h)             Low-pass filtered hysteresis pressure (decibars)* T(l)             Long-response low-pass filtered temperature (°C)* T(s)             Short-response low-pass filtered temperature (°C)* P(l)             Low-pass filtered pressure (decibars)* dO(c)/dt         Sensor current gradient (µamps/sec)* dP/dt            Filtered package velocity (db/sec)* dT               Low-pass filtered thermal diffusion estimate (T(s) – T(l))* C(4) – C(9)      Response coefficientsCTD dissolved O2 residuals are shown in figures O2 residuals bystation (-0.01°C  T1-T2  0.01°C). through Deep O2 residuals by station(Pressure >= 2000dbar).Fig 3.29: O2 residuals by station (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.30: O2 residuals by pressure (-0.01°C ≤ T1-T2 ≤ 0.01°C).Fig 3.31: Deep O2 residuals by station (Pressure >= 2000dbar).The standard deviations of 2.98 (µmol/kg) for all oxygens and 0.69(µmol/kg) for deep oxygens are only presented as general indicators ofgoodness of fit. SIO makes no claims regarding the precision oraccuracy of CTD dissolved O2 data.A few minor problems with acquisition of data complicated the CTDdissolved oxygen fits. The primary pumps were partially blocked onstation 4. This resulted in the use of the up-cast for data reportinginstead of the standard down-cast profile. On stations 3, 36, 59 and65 the winch stopped on CTD decent. This caused the data from theoxygen sensor to report different values at the same pressure depth.These data were coded questionable for those perspective pressuredepth regions. For a number of near surface bottle values, the down-casts did not match the bottle value, however the up-cast did match.These samples were comment on in the bottle quality comments and codedgood, but the data associated with those trips were weighted 0 in thenon-linear least squares fitting algorithm and not used for the fit.[Mill82] Millard, R.

The autosal was recently calibrated before this cruise,I08S. The salinometer readings were logged on a computer using in-house LabView program developed by Carl Mattson. This is to ensurestabilize reading values and improve accuracy. Salinity analyses wereperformed after samples had equilibrated to laboratory temperature,usually 8 hours after collection. The salinometer was standardized foreach group of samples analyzed (usually 2 casts and up to 72 samples)using two bottles of standard seawater: one at the beginning and endof each set of measurements. The salinometer output was logged to acomputer file. The software prompted the analyst to flush theinstrument's cell and change samples when appropriate. Prior to eachrun a sub-standard flush, approximately 200 ml, of the conductivitycell was conducted to flush out the DI water used in between runs. Foreach calibration standard, the salinometer cell was initially flushed6 times before a set of conductivity ratio reading was taken. For eachsample, the salinometer cell was initially flushed at least 3 timesbefore a set of conductivity ratio readings were taken.IAPSO Standard Seawater Batch P-158 was used to standardize all casts.Fig. 3.31: Salinity standard IAPSO Batch P-1584.2  Sampling and Data ProcessingThe salinity samples were collected in 200 ml Kimax high-aluminaborosilicate bottles that had been rinsed at least three times withsample water prior to filling. The bottles were sealed with custom-made plastic insert thimbles and Nalgene screw caps. This assemblyprovides very low container dissolution and sample evaporation. Priorto sample collection, inserts were inspected for proper fit and looseinserts replaced to insure an airtight seal. Laboratory temperaturewas also monitored electronically throughout the cruise. PSS-78salinity [UNESCO1981] was calculated for each sample from the measuredconductivity ratios. The offset between the initial standard seawatervalue and its reference value was applied to each sample. Then thedifference (if any) between the initial and final vials of standardseawater was applied to each sample as a linear function of elapsedrun time. The corrected salinity data was then incorporated into thecruise database.As the cruise progressed north temperatures in the lab became warmer,which affected analysis for station data 48 and 49. Samples wereflagged in the database and reflected in the quality commentsdocumented for this report APPENDIX.[UNESCO1981] UNESCO 1981.

A new column was put on if the efficiency fell  below 97%.5.2  Equipment and TechniquesNutrient analyses (phosphate, silicate, nitrate+nitrite, nitrite andammonia) were performed on a Seal Analytical continuous-flowAutoAnalyzer 3 (AA3). The methods used are described by Gordon et al[Gordon1992] Hager et al. [Hager1972], and Atlas et al. [Atlas1971].Details of modification of analytical methods used in this cruise arealso compatible with the methods described in the nutrient section ofthe GO-SHIP repeat hydrography manual (Hydes et al., 2010)[Hydes2010].5.3  Nitrate/Nitrite AnalysisA modification of the Armstrong et al. (1967) [Armstrong1967]procedure was used for the analysis of nitrate and nitrite. Fornitrate analysis, a seawater sample was passed through a cadmiumcolumn where the nitrate was reduced to nitrite. This nitrite was thendiazotized with sulfanilamide and coupled withN-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine to form a red dye. The sample was thenpassed through a 10mm flowcell and absorbance measured at 540nm. Theprocedure was the same for the nitrite analysis but without thecadmium column.**REAGENTS**Sulfanilamide   Dissolve 10g sulfamilamide in 1.2N HCl and bring to 1 liter volume.   Add 2 drops of 40% surfynol 465/485 surfactant. Store at room   temperature in a dark poly bottle.   Note: 40% Surfynol 465/485 is 20% 465 plus 20% 485 in DIW.N-(1-Naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (N-1-N)   Dissolve 1g N-1-N in DIW, bring to 1 liter volume. Add 2 drops 40%   surfynol 465/485 surfactant. Store at room temperature in a dark   poly bottle. Discard if the solution turns dark reddish brown.Imidazole Buffer   Dissolve 13.6g imidazole in ~3.8 liters DIW. Stir for at least 30   minutes to completely dissolve. Add 60 ml of CuSO4 + NH4Cl mix (see   below). Add 4 drops 40% Surfynol 465/485 surfactant. Let sit   overnight before proceeding. Using a calibrated pH meter, adjust to   pH of 7.83-7.85 with 10% (1.2N) HCl (about 10 ml of acid, depending   on exact strength). Bring final solution to 4L with DIW. Store at   room temperature.NH4Cl + CuSO4 mix   Dissolve 2g cupric sulfate in DIW, bring to 100 m1 volume (2%).   Dissolve 250g ammonium chloride in DIW, bring to l liter volume.   Add 5ml of 2% CuSO4 solution to this NH4Cl stock. This should last   many months.5.4  Phosphate AnalysisOrtho-Phosphate was analyzed using a modification of the Bernhardt andWilhelms (1967) [Bernhardt1967] method. Acidified ammonium molybdatewas added to a seawater sample to produce phosphomolybdic acid, whichwas then reduced to phosphomolybdous acid (a blue compound) followingthe addition of dihydrazine sulfate. The sample was passed through a10mm flowcell and absorbance measured at 820nm (880nm after station59, see section on analytical problems for details).**REAGENTS**Ammonium Molybdate H2SO4 sol'n   Pour 420 ml of DIW into a 2 liter Ehrlenmeyer flask or beaker,   place this flask or beaker into an ice bath. SLOWLY add 330 ml of   conc H2SO4. This solution gets VERY HOT!! Cool in the ice bath.   Make up as much as necessary in the above proportions.   Dissolve 27g ammonium molybdate in 250ml of DIW. Bring to 1 liter   volume with the cooled sulfuric acid sol'n. Add 3 drops of 15% DDS   surfactant. Store in a dark poly bottle.Dihydrazine Sulfate   Dissolve 6.4g dihydazine sulfate in DIW, bring to 1 liter volume   and refrigerate.5.5  Silicate AnalysisSilicate was analyzed using the basic method of Armstrong et al.(1967). Acidified ammonium molybdate was added to a seawater sample toproduce silicomolybdic acid which was then reduced to silicomolybdousacid (a blue compound) following the addition of stannous chloride.The sample was passed through a 10mm flowcell and measured at 660nm.**REAGENTS**Tartaric Acid   Dissolve 200g tartaric acid in DW and bring to 1 liter volume.   Store at room temperature in a poly bottle.Ammonium Molybdate   Dissolve 10.8g Ammonium Molybdate Tetrahydrate in 1000ml dilute   H2SO4. (Dilute H2SO4 = 2.8ml conc H2SO4 or 6.4ml of H2SO4 diluted   for PO4 moly per liter DW) (dissolve powder, then add H2SO4) Add   3-5 drops 15% SDS surfactant per liter of solution.Stannous Chloride   stock: (as needed)   Dissolve 40g of stannous chloride in 100 ml 5N HCl. Refrigerate in   a poly bottle.   NOTE: Minimize oxygen introduction by swirling rather than shaking   the solution. Discard if a white solution (oxychloride) forms.   working: (every 24 hours) Bring 5 ml of stannous chloride stock to   200 ml final volume with 1.2N HCl. Make up daily - refrigerate when   not in use in a dark poly bottle.5.6  Ammonium Analysis**Fluorometric method**   Ammonia is analyzed using the method described by Kerouel and   Aminot [Kerouel1997]. The sample is combined with a working reagent   made up of ortho-phthalaldehyde, sodium sulfite and borate buffer   and heated to 75degC. Fluorescence proportional to the NH4   concentration is emitted at 460nm following excitation at 370nm.**REAGENTS**Ortho-phthalaldehyde stock (OPH):   Dissolve 8g of ortho-phthalaldehyde in 200mls ethanol and mix   thoroughly. Store in a dark glass bottle and keep refrigerated.Sodium sulfite stock:   Dissolve 0.8g sodium sulfite in DIW and dilute up to 100ml. Store   in a glass bottle, replace weekly.Borate buffer   Dissolve 120g disodium tetraborate in DIW and bring up to 4L   volume.Working reagent:   In the following order and proportions combine: 1L borate buffer   20ml stock orthophthalaldehyde, 2 ml stock sodium sulfite, 4 drops   40% Surfynol 465/485 surfactant and mix. Store in a glass bottle   and protect from light. Replace weekly. Make this up at least one   day prior to use. Store in dark bottle and protect from outside   air/nh4 contamination.5.7  SamplingNutrient samples were drawn into 40 ml polypropylene screw-cappedcentrifuge tubes. The tubes and caps were cleaned with 10% HCl andrinsed 2-3 times with sample before filling. Samples were analyzedwithin 1-3 hours after sample collection, allowing sufficient time forall samples to reach room temperature. The centrifuge tubes fitdirectly onto the sampler.5.8  Data collection and processingData collection and processing was done with the software (ACCE ver6.10) provided with the instrument from Seal Analytical. After eachrun, the charts were reviewed for any problems during the run, anyblank was subtracted, and final concentrations (micro moles/liter)were calculated, based on a linear curve fit. Once the run wasreviewed and concentrations calculated a text file was created. Thattext file was reviewed for possible problems and then converted toanother text file with only sample identifiers and nutrientconcentrations that was merged with other bottle data.5.9  Standards and Glassware calibrationPrimary standards for silicate (Na2SiF6), nitrate (KNO3), nitrite(NaNO2), and phosphate (KH2PO4) were obtained from Johnson MattheyChemical Co. and/or Fisher Scientific. The supplier reports puritiesof >98%, 99.999%, 97%, and 99.999 respectively.All glass volumetric flasks and pipettes were gravimetricallycalibrated prior to the cruise. The primary standards were dried andweighed out to 0.1mg prior to the cruise. The exact weight was notedfor future reference. When primary standards were made, the flaskvolume at 20C, the weight of the powder, and the temperature of thesolution were used to buoyancy-correct the weight, calculate the exactconcentration of the solution, and determine how much of the primarywas needed for the desired concentrations of secondary standard.Primary and secondary standards were made up every 7-10days. The newstandards were compared to the old before use.All the reagent solutions, primary and secondary standards were madewith fresh distilled deionized water (DIW).Standardizations were performed at the beginning of each group ofanalyses with working standards prepared prior to each run from asecondary. Working standards were made up in low nutrient seawater(LNSW). Two different batches of LNSW were used on the cruise. Thefirst, used for initial underway and stations 001-054, was collectedoff shore of coastal California and treated in the lab. The water wasfirst filtered through a 0.45 micron filter then re-circulated for ~8hours through a 0.2 micron filter, passed a UV lamp and through asecond 0.2 micron filter. The actual concentration of nutrients inthis water was empirically determined during the standardizationcalculations. The second batch of LNSW, used for stations 055-083, wascollected off shore of coastal California, filtered, and UV treated inthe same manner described for batch one. The concentrations in micro-moles per liter of the working standards used were:                - |  N+N  | PO4  | SiO3 | NO2   | NH4                   | (uM)  | (uM) | (uM) | (uM)  | (uM)               =======================================                0 |  0.0  | 0.0  |  0.0 | 0.0   | 0.0                ---+-------+------+------+-------+-----                3 | 15.50 | 1.2  | 60   | 0.50  | 2.0                ---+-------+------+------+-------+-----                5 | 31.00 | 2.4  | 120  | 1.00  | 4.0                ---+-------+------+------+-------+-----                7 | 46.50 | 3.6  | 180  | 1.50  | 6.0 5.10  Quality ControlAll final data was reported in micro-moles/kg. NO3, PO4, and NO2 werereported to two decimals places and SIL to one. Accuracy is based onthe quality of the standards the levels are:                 NO3   | 0.05 µM (micro moles/Liter)                 -------+-----------------------------                 PO4   | 0.004 µM                                    -------+-----------------------------                 SIL   | 2-4 µM                                      -------+-----------------------------                 NO2   | 0.05 µM                                     -------+-----------------------------                 NH4   | 0.03 µM                                    As is standard ODF practice, a deep calibration "check" sample was runwith each set of samples to estimate precision within the cruise. Thedata are tabulated below.               Parameter | Concentration (µM) | stddev               -----------+--------------------+--------               NO3       | 31.20              | 0.12                 -----------+--------------------+--------               PO4       |  2.16              | 0.02                 -----------+--------------------+--------               SIL       | 99.3               | 0.51                   SIO/ODF has been using Reference Materials for Nutrients in Seawater(RMNS) on repeat Hydrography cruises as another estimate of accuracyand precision for each cruise since 2009. The accuracy and precision(standard deviation) for this cruise were measured by analysis of aRMNS with each run.

All nutrient levels werebelow detection limit and good for duration of cruise.Sulfite reagent was replaced once due to degradation in detected inOPA working reagent. Occasional phosphate baseline drifts and jumpswere mitigated with periodic soap and bleach cleaning.Nitrate and nitrite detector gains were reset at station 045 due to anincreased sensitivity and high standard readings slightly above theset ranges within the software.[Armstrong1967] Armstrong, F.A.J., Stearns, C.A., and                Strickland, J.D.H., "The measurement of upwelling and                subsequent biological processes by means of the                Technicon Autoanalyzer and associated equipment,"                Deep-Sea Research, 14, pp.381-389 (1967).[Atlas1971]     Atlas, E.L., Hager, S.W., Gordon, L.I., and                Park, P.K., "A Practical Manual for Use of the Technicon                AutoAnalyzer in Seawater Nutrient Analyses Revised,"                Technical Report 215, Reference 71-22, p.49, Oregon State                University, Department of Oceanography (1971).[Aoyama2006]    Aoyama, M., 2006: 2003 Intercomparison                Exercise for Reference Material for Nutrients in Seawater                in a Seawater Matrix, Technical Reports of the                Meteorological Research Institute No.50, 91pp, Tsukuba,                Japan.[Aoyama2007]    Aoyama, M., Susan B., Minhan, D., Hideshi,                D., Louis, I.

Thetitration of the samples and the data logging were controlled by PCLabView software. Thiosulfate was dispensed by a Dosimat 765 buretdriver fitted with a 1.0 ml burette. ODF used a whole-bottle modified-Winkler titration following the technique of Carpenter (Carpenter1965) with modifications by Culberson (Culberson 1991) but with higherconcentrations of potassium iodate standard approximately 0.012N, andthiosulfate solution approximately 55 gm/l. Pre-made liquid potassiumiodate standards were run every day (approximately every 4-5stations), unless changes were made to the system or reagents.Reagent/distilled water blanks were determined every day or more oftenif a change in reagents required it to account for presence ofoxidizing or reducing agents.6.2  Sampling and Data Processing2699 oxygen measurements were made. Samples were collected fordissolved oxygen analyses soon after the rosette was brought on board.Using a silicone drawing tube, nominal 125ml volume-calibrated iodineflasks were rinsed 3 times with minimal agitation, then filled andallowed to overflow for at least 3 flask volumes. The sample drawingtemperatures were measured with an electronic resistance temperaturedetector (RTD) embedded in the drawing tube. These temperatures wereused to calculate umol/kg concentrations, and as a diagnostic check ofbottle integrity. Reagents (MnCl2 then NaI/NaOH) were added to fixthe oxygen before stoppering. The flasks were shaken twice (10-12inversions) to assure thorough dispersion of the precipitate, onceimmediately after drawing, and then again after about 30-40 minutes.The samples were analyzed within 2-14 hours of collection, and thedata incorporated into the cruise database.Thiosulfate normalities were calculated for each standardization andcorrected to 20 deg C. The 20 deg C normalities and the blanks wereplotted versus time and were reviewed for possible problems. Theblanks and thiosulfate normalities for each batch of thiosulfate werestable enough that no smoothing was necessary.6.3  Volumetric CalibrationOxygen flask volumes were determined gravimetrically with degasseddeionized water to determine flask volumes at ODF's chemistrylaboratory. This is done once before using flasks for the first timeand periodically thereafter when a suspect volume is detected.  Thevolumetric flasks used in preparing standards were volume-calibratedby the same method, as was the 10 ml Dosimat buret used to dispensestandard iodate solution.6.4  StandardsLiquid potassium iodate standards were prepared in 6 liter batches andbottled in sterile glass bottles at ODF's chemistry laboratory priorto the expedition. The normality of the liquid standard was determinedby calculation from weight. The standard was supplied by Alfa Aesarand has a reported purity of 99.4-100.4%. All other reagents were"reagent grade" and were tested for levels of oxidizing and reducingimpurities prior to use.6.5  NarrativeInitial setup and reagent preparation occurred while in the port ofFremantle, WA on 2016-02-05. Setup was smooth, with no issues.Standards were run about every 24 hours during the transit to station1 to monitor thiosulfate stability. Underway samples were also beingcollected and analyzed at during the transit.After station 25, the thiosulfate was topped off from the workingstock. A subsequent standardization showed an out of spec jump in thethiosulfate normality. Standardizations performed in the following 24hours showed this new normality to be stable.Around station 65 problems with the UV Detector box occurred. Thebehavior observed was a rising zero offset when the detector wascompletely blocked. Swapping to the spare detector box appeared tosolve the issue.On station 74, the initial estimates of how much MnCl2 and NaI/NaOHwere needed proved to be incorrect. New batches of both reagents weremade and were in use by station 75. No analytical issues were noteddue to the new reagents.No samples were lost due to analytical error.7  TOTAL ALKALINITYPI   * Andrew G. Dickson – Scripps Institution of OceanographyTechnicians   * David Cervantes   * Heather Page (Graduate Student)7.1  Total AlkalinityThe total alkalinity of a sea water sample is defined as the number ofmoles of hydrogen ion equivalent to the excess of proton acceptors(bases formed from weak acids with a dissociation constant K ≤10–4.5 at 25°C and zero ionic strength) over proton donors (acids withK > 10–4.5) in 1 kilogram of sample.7.2  Total Alkalinity Measurement SystemSamples are dispensed using a Sample Delivery System (SDS) consistingof a volumetric pipette, various relay valves, and two air pumpscontrolled by LabVIEW 2012. Before filling the jacketed cell with anew sample for analysis, the volumetric pipette is cleared of anyresidual from the previous sample with the aforementioned air pumps.The pipette is then rinsed with new sample and filled, allowing foroverflow and time for the sample temperature to equilibrate. Thesample bottle temperature is measured using a DirecTemp thermistorprobe inserted into the sample bottle and the volumetric pipettetemperature is measured using a DirecTemp surface probe placeddirectly on the pipette. These temperature measurements are used toconvert the sample volume to mass for analysis.Samples are analyzed using an open cell titration procedure using two250 mL jacketed cells. One sample is undergoing titration while thesecond is being prepared and equilibrating to 20°C for analysis. Afteran initial aliquot of approximately 2.3-2.4 mL of standardizedhydrochloric acid (~0.1M HCl in ~0.6M NaCl solution), the sample isstirred for 5 minutes while air is bubbled into it at a rate of 200scc/m to remove any liberated carbon dioxide gas. A Metrohm 876Dosimat Plus is used for all standardized hydrochloric acid additions.After equilibration, ~19 aliquots of 0.04 ml are added. Between the pHrange of 3.5 to 3.0, the progress of the titration is monitored usinga pH glass electrode/reference electrode cell, and the totalalkalinity is computed from the titrant volume and e.m.f. measurementsusing a non-linear least-squares approach ([Dickson2007]). An Agilent34970A Data Acquisition/Switch Unit with a 34901A multiplexer is usedto read the voltage measurements from the electrode and monitor thetemperatures from the sample, acid, and room. The calculations forthis procedure are performed automatically using LabVIEW 2012.7.3  Sample CollectionSamples for total alkalinity measurements were taken at all I08Stations (1-83). Two Niskin bottles at each station were sampled twicefor duplicate measurements except for stations where 15 or less Niskinbottles were sampled. Using silicone tubing, the total alkalinitysamples were drawn from Niskin bottles into 250 mL Pyrex bottles,making sure to rinse the bottles and Teflon sleeved glass stoppers atleast twice before the final filling. A headspace of approximately 3mL was removed and 0.06 mL of saturated mercuric chloride solution wasadded to each sample for preservation. After sampling was completed,each sample's temperature was equilibrated to approximately 20°C usinga Thermo Scientific RTE water bath.7.4  Problems and TroubleshootingNormally after samples are collected, they are placed into a waterbath to equilibrate the sample temperature near 20°C. For I08, thiscaused a problem for our SDS. Heating the samples to 20°C resulted intoo much gas being released from the samples. The SDS tubing andpipette began to fill with such a large amount of gas bubbles from thesample that the SDS pipette failed to fill completely resulting ininaccurate sample sizes. To remedy this problem, we beganequilibrating our samples to 11°C and increased the pipette fillingtime from 70 seconds to 80 seconds. The amount of gas bubbles formingin the SDS immensely decreased and the SDS pipette began to fillnormally.Throughout I08, the Agilent 34970A Data Acquisition/Switch Unit andthe LabVIEW software occasionally displayed an error when beginning atitration. A software communication error is suspected but this cannotbe confirmed at sea. When this error occurs, the Agilent Unit willimmediately beep and an error message will be visible on the AgilentUnit’s display. A LabVIEW error message appears on the computer afterapproximately 1.65 mL of standardized hydrochloric acid is addedduring the titration’s initial aliquot. If this error message isnoticed and attended to immediately, the Agilent Unit will "reset"itself and begin to process the titration normally, resulting in areliable total alkalinity measurement. If the error is not caught intime, the total alkalinity measurement is unacceptable. One sample waslost because the operator was unable to notice the Agilent Unit'serror in time.7.5  Quality ControlDickson laboratory Certified Reference Material (CRM) Batch 152 wasused to determine the accuracy of the total alkalinity analyses. Thecertified total alkalinity value for Batch 152 is 2216.94 ± 0.60 molkg:sup`-1`. This reference material was analyzed 108 times throughoutI08 at least once for every station. The preliminary B152 measuredvalue average for I08 is 2216.53 ± 0.70 mol kg^(-1).Throughout I08, empty pre-weighed glass bottles with rubber stoppersand aluminum caps were filled with deionized water from the SDS andthen crimped shut. These sealed bottles will be weighed again oncethey return to shore to detect (or confirm) any possible or suspectedshifts in volume dispensing throughout the cruise that could havecaused reference material, and therefore sample, value shifts.If greater than 15 Niskin bottles were sampled at a station, twoNiskin bottles on that station were sampled twice to conduct duplicateanalyses. If 15 or less Niskin bottles were sampled at a station, onlyone Niskin on that station was sampled twice for duplicate analyses. Atotal of 138 Niskin bottles were sampled for duplicate measurementsand gave an average difference of 0.01 ± 1.01 mol kg^(-1).Each I08 station's total alkalinity measurements were compared tomeasurements taken from the neighboring I08 2016 stations and the I082007 stations of similar if not identical coordinates.1811 total alkalinity values were submitted out of 1812 sampled Niskinbottles. Corrections have already been applied for the CertifiedReference Material comparison and also for the mercuric chloridedilution. A normalized total alkalinity plot was analyzed to aid inidentifying any possible inaccurate measurements. Although mostcorrections have been made and it is unlikely that additional oneswill need to be performed, this data should be considered preliminaryuntil the correction for any shifts in total volume dispensed persample is checked, confirmed and applied. This assessment cannot beaccomplished until the pre-weighed bottles of filled deionized waterare reweighed back on land.8  DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC)PI’s   * Rik Wanninkhof (NOAA/AOML)   * Richard A. Feely (NOAA/PMEL)Technicians   * Charles Featherstone (NOAA/AOML)   * Dana Greeley (NOAA/PMEL)8.1  Sample collectionSamples for DIC measurements were drawn (according to proceduresoutlined in the PICES Publication, *Guide to Best Practices for OceanCO2 Measurements* [Dickson2007]) from Niskin bottles into 294 mlborosilicate glass bottles using silicone tubing. The flasks wererinsed once and filled from the bottom with care not to entrain anybubbles, overflowing by at least one-half volume. The sample tube waspinched off and withdrawn, creating a 6 ml headspace, followed by 0.16ml of saturated HgCl2 solution which was added as a preservative. Thesample bottles were then sealed with glass stoppers lightly coveredwith Apiezon-L grease and were stored at room temperature for amaximum of 12 hours.The analysis was done by coulometry with two analytical systems (AOML3 and AOML 4) used simultaneously on the cruise. Each system consistedof a coulometer (CM5015 UIC Inc) coupled with a Dissolved InorganicCarbon Extractor (DICE). The DICE system was developed by Esa Peltolaand Denis Pierrot of NOAA/AOML and Dana Greeley of NOAA/PMEL tomodernize a carbon extractor called SOMMA ([Johnson1985],[Johnson1987], [Johnson1993], [Johnson1992], [Johnson1999]).The two DICE systems (AOML 3 and AOML 4) were set up in a seagoingcontainer modified for use as a shipboard laboratory on the aft mainworking deck of the R/V Roger Revelle.8.2  DIC AnalysisIn coulometric analysis of DIC, all carbonate species are converted toCO2 (gas) by addition of excess hydrogen ion (acid) to the seawatersample, and the evolved CO2 gas is swept into the titration cell ofthe coulometer with pure air or compressed nitrogen, where it reactsquantitatively with a proprietary reagent based on ethanolamine togenerate hydrogen ions. In this process, the solution changes fromblue to colorless, triggering a current through the cell and causingcoulometrical generation of OH^(-) ions at the anode. The OH^(-) ionsreact with the H^(+) and the solution turns blue again. A beam of lightis shone through the solution, and a photometric detector at theopposite side of the cell senses the change in transmission. Once thepercent transmission reaches its original value, the coulometrictitration is stopped, and the amount of CO2 that enters the cell isdetermined by integrating the total change during the titration.8.3  DIC CalculationCalculation of the amount of CO2 injected was according to the CO2handbook [DOE1994].  The concentration of CO2 ([CO2]) in the sampleswas determined according to:                       (Counts – Blank * Run Time) * Kµmol/count   CO2 = Cal. Factor * -----------------------------------------                           pipette volume * density of samplewhere Cal. Factor is the calibration factor, Counts is the instrumentreading at the end of the analysis, Blank is the counts/minutedetermined from blank runs performed at least once for each cellsolution, Run Time is the length of coulometric titration (inminutes), and K is the conversion factor from counts to micromoles.The instrument has a salinity sensor, but all DIC values wererecalculated to a molar weight (µmol/kg) using density obtained fromthe CTD’s salinity. The DIC values were corrected for dilution due tothe addition of 0.16 ml of saturated HgCl2 used for samplepreservation. The total water volume of the sample bottles was 288 ml(calibrated by Esa Peltola, AOML). The correction factor used fordilution was 1.00055. A correction was also applied for the offsetfrom the CRM. This additive correction was applied for each cell usingthe CRM value obtained at the beginning of the cell. The averagecorrection was 1.82 µmol/kg for AOML 3 and 3.18 µmol/kg for AOML 4.The coulometer cell solution was replaced after 25 – 28 mg of carbonwas titrated, typically after 9 – 12 hours of continuous use. Normallythe blank is less than 30, but we were forced to run them with blanksin the 12 – 48 range.8.4  Calibration, Accuracy, and PrecisionThe stability of each coulometer cell solution was confirmed threedifferent ways.1. Gas loops were run at the beginning of each cell2. CRM’s supplied by Dr. A. Dickson of SIO, were measured near the   beginning; middle and end of each cell3. Duplicate samples from the same Niskin were run throughout the   life of the cell solution.Each coulometer was calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2(99.999%) by means of an 8-port valve [Wilke1993] outfitted with twocalibrated sample loops of different sizes (~1ml and ~2ml). Theinstruments were each separately calibrated at the beginning of eachcell with a minimum of two sets of these gas loop injections.The accuracy of the DICE measurement is determined with the use ofstandards (Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting offiltered and UV irradiated seawater) supplied by Dr. A. Dickson ofScripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The CRM accuracy isdetermined manometrically on land in San Diego and the DIC datareported to the data base have been corrected to this batch 152 CRMvalue. The CRM certified value for this batch is 2020.88 µmol/kg1.The precision of the two DICE systems can be demonstrated via thereplicate samples. Approximately 12% of the Niskins sampled wereduplicates taken as a check of our precision. These replicate sampleswere interspersed throughout the station analysis for qualityassurance and integrity of the coulometer cell solutions. The averageabsolute difference from the mean of these replicates is 1.51 µmol/kg- No major systematic differences between the replicates wereobserved.The pipette volume was determined by taking aliquots of distilledwater from volumes at known temperatures. The weights with theappropriate densities were used to determine the volume of thepipettes.Calibration data during this cruise:  UNIT  |  L Loop  |  S Loop  |  Pipette  |   Ave CRM1    | Std Dev1 | Dupes2 ============================================================================== AOML 3 | 1.002367 | 1.000603 | 27.927 ml | 2019.15, N=40 |   1.29   |  1.56  --------+----------+----------+-----------+---------------+----------+-------- AOML 4 | 1.000058 | 0.998393 | 29.306 ml | 2016.28, N=42 |   3.18   |  1.45  8.5  Underway DIC SamplesUnderway samples were collected from the flow thru system in theforward Main Lab during transit. Discrete DIC samples were collectedapproximately every 4 hours with duplicates every fifth sample. Atotal of 80 discrete DIC samples including duplicates were collectedwhile underway. The average difference for replicates of underway DICsamples was 1.24 µmol/kg and the average STDEV was 0.88.8.6  SummaryThe overall performance of the analytical equipment was good duringthe cruise. During setup  of the DICE Lab van it was discovered thatthe AOML 4 cooler housing the  8-port valve outfitted with twocalibrated sample loops of different sizes (~1ml and ~2ml) was filledwith water, which apparently leak from the hatch in the roof aboveduring shipment to Fremantle. The 8-port valve and two positonactuator control module was replaced with a new one and the two sampleloops were removed from the old 8-port valve and connected to the newvalve. The gas calibrations seemed to vary throughout the cruise onAOML 4, but did not affect the data. Several small leaks were fixed inthe HSG and compressed air lines at the beginning of the cruise.Including the duplicates, over 2013 samples were analyzed from 83 CTDcasts for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) which means that there is aDIC value for approximately 66% of the Niskins tripped. The DIC datareported to the database directly from the ship are to be consideredpreliminary until a more thorough quality assurance can be completedshore side.[DOE1994]     DOE (U.S. Department of Energy).

Fong9.1  SamplingSamples were collected in 250 mL Pyrex glass bottles and sealed usinggrey butyl rubber stoppers held in place by aluminum-crimped caps.Each bottle was rinsed two times and allowed to overflow by oneadditional bottle volume. Prior to sealing, each sample was given a 1%headspace and poisoned with 0.02% of the sample volume of saturatedmercuric chloride (HgCl2). Samples were collected only from Niskinbottles that were also being sampled for both total alkalinity anddissolved inorganic carbon in order to completely characterize thecarbon system. Additionally, two duplicate samples were collected fromalmost all stations for quality control purposes.9.2  AnalysispH was measured spectrophotometrically on the total hydrogen scaleusing an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer and in accordance with themethods outlined by Carter et al., 2013 [Carter2013]. A Kloehn V6syringe pump was used to autonomously fill, mix, and dispense samplethrough the custom 10cm flow-through jacketed cell. A Thermo NESLABRTE-7 recirculating water bath was used to maintain the celltemperature at 25.0°C during analyses, and a YSI 4600 precisionthermometer and probe were used to monitor and record the temperatureof each sample immediately after the spectrophotometric measurementswere taken. The indicator meta-cresol purple (mCP) was used to measurethe absorbance of light measured at two different wavelengths (434 nm,578 nm) corresponding to the maximum absorbance peaks for the acidicand basic forms of the indicator dye. A baseline absorbance was alsomeasured and subtracted from these wavelengths. The baselineabsorbance was determined by averaging the absorbances from 725-735nm.The ratio of the absorbances was then used to calculate pH on thetotal scale using the equations outlined in Liu et al., 2011[Liu2011]. The salinity data used was obtained from the conductivitysensor on the CTD. The salinity data was later corroborated byshipboard measurements.9.3  ReagentsThe mCP indicator dye was made up to a concentration of approximately2.0mM and a total ionic strength of 0.7 M. A total of 2 batches wereused during Leg 1 of the cruise. The pHs of these batches was adjustedwith 0.1 M solutions of HCl and NaOH (in 0.6 M NaCl background) toapproximately 7.3, measured with a pH meter calibrated with NBSbuffers. The indicator was obtained from Dr. Robert Byrne at theUniversity and Southern Florida and was purified using the flashchromatography technique described by Patsavas et al., 2013[Patsavas2013].9.4  Data ProcessingAn indicator dye is itself an acid-base system that can change the pHof the seawater to which it is added. Therefore, it is important toestimate and correct for this perturbation to the seawater’s pH foreach batch of dye used during the cruise. To determine thiscorrection, multiple bottles from each station were measured twice,once with a single addition of indicator dye and once with a doubleaddition of indicator dye. The measured absorbance ratio (R) and anisosbestic absorbance (A(iso)) were determined for eachmeasurement, where:                              A    - A                               578    base                          R = ------------                              A    - A                               434    baseand                          A    = A   - A                           iso    488   baseThe change in R for a given change in A(iso), ∆R/∆A(iso), was then plotted against the measured R-value for the normal amount of dye and fitted with a linear regression. From this fit the slope and y-intercept(b and a respectively) are determined by:                         ∆R/∆A(iso), = bR + aFrom this the corrected ratio (R') corresponding to the measuredabsorbance ratio if no indicator dye were present can be determinedby:                       R' = R - A(iso)(bR + a)9.5  Standardization/ResultsThe precision of the data was assessed from measurements of duplicateanalyses, replicate analyses (two successive measurements on onebottle), certified reference materials (CRMs) from Batch 152 (providedby Dr. Andrew Dickson, UCSD). CRMs were measured twice a day over thecourse of the cruise.The overall precision determined from duplicate analyses was ±0.00039(n=161). The overall precision determined from replicate analyses was±0.00029 (n=161). Additionally, 98 measurements were made on 49bottles of Certified Reference Materials, which were found to have apH of 7.8708 ±0.00063 (n=98) and a within-bottle standard deviation of±0.00041 (n=98).The pH of the entire transect is shown as a section in pH Section.9.6  ProblemsMany of the samples had high dissolved gas content and degassed whenbrought to room temperature. This could be clearly seen in theformation of bubbles inside the sealed sample bottles and in thespectrophotometric pH system (Kloehn syringe pump, sample tubing, andthe 10 cm cell). Bubbles were especially difficult to eliminate in theKloehn syringe pump, which would accumulate large bubbles at the topafter running a number of samples in each station. Efforts were madeto reduce bubble formation by verifying all pump fittings were tight,slowing down the speed of the syringe pump, holding samples below25°C, and analysis at a lower temperature (10°C). Bubbles were clearedfrom the syringe after every station by flushing with ethanol,followed by DI water. The potential for the bubbles to alter thesample pH was a concern, and the significance of this error wasevaluated by examining a handful of duplicates which were run afterthe accumulation of large bubbles in the syringe and immediately afterclearing bubbles from the syringe. The difference of these duplicatessuggested there was no significant effect of the bubbles on sample pH.Samples for two stations (Stations 25 and 26) were held and measuredat 10°C in an attempt to reduce bubble formation, but no dramaticimprovement in bubble formation was observed. Furthermore, thebaseline absorbances at 10°C were consistently high (as high as0.006). The decision was therefore made to continue running samples at25°C.Bubbles also occasionally formed in the water bath that controls themeasurement temperature. In one instance, an extremely large bubble inthe tubing stopped the circulation of water around the 10 cm cell andcaused a sudden drop in temperature. This appeared to affect the pH ofone sample, which deviated from a typical profile and was flagged asquestionable in the preliminary data. All water bath fittings werereadjusted and retightened afterwards to prevent bubble formation.The Labview program that controls our automated pH system crashed onceduring the cruise, resulting in the loss of data for one sample.Our HgCl2 dispenser became clogged due to the cold temperatures inthe staging bay and eventually became unusable by the middle of thecruise. As the dispenser was failing, the volume of HgCl2 dispensedinto some of the samples was variable, although no effect on the pHwas detected. After the dispenser failed completely, we used anEppendorf pipette to deliver 60 µL of saturated HgCl2 solution intothe samples.Fig. 9.1: pH Section          Section of pH on the total scale along I08S (Stations 1 to 83).          Data were DIVA-gridded, and a few contours are shown. Because          measurements at Station 25 and 26 were at 10°C, as opposed to           25°C for all the other stations, the pH data shown here have been          recalculated at 25°C from the measured pH and total alkalinity,          using the constants of Lueker et al. (2000) [Lueker2000].[Carter2013]   Carter, B.R., Radich, J.A., Doyle, H.L., and               Dickson, A.G., "An Automated Spectrometric System for               Discrete and Underway Seawater pH Measurements,"               Limnology and Oceanography: Methods, 2013.  [Liu2011]      Liu, X., Patsavas, M.C., Byrne R.H., "Purification               and Characterization of meta Cresol Purple for               Spectrophotometric Seawater pH Measurements," Environmental               Science and Technology, 2011.  [Lueker2000]   Lueker, T.J., Dickson, A.G., Keeling, C.D.               "Ocean pCO2 calculated from dissolved inorganic carbon,               alkalinity, and equations for K1 and K2: validation based               on laboratory measurements of CO2 in gas and seawater at               equilibrium," Marine Chemistry, 2000.[Patsavas2013] Patsavas, M.C., Byrne, R.H.,  and Liu X.               "Purification of meta-cresol purple and cresol red by               flash chromatography: Procedures for ensuring accurate               spectrophotometric seawater pH measurements," Marine               Chemistry, 2013.10  CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and SF_6Analysts   * Jim Happell   * Charlene Grall   * Sarah Bercovici10.1  Sample CollectionAll samples were collected from depth using 10.4 liter Niskin bottles.None of the Niskin bottles used showed a CFC contamination throughoutthe cruise. All bottles in use remained inside the CTD hanger betweencasts.Sampling was conducted first at each station, according to WOCEprotocol. This avoids contamination by air introduced at the top ofthe Niskin bottle as water was being removed. A water sample wascollected from the Niskin bottle petcock using viton tubing to fill a300 ml BOD bottle. The viton tubing was flushed of air bubbles. TheBOD bottle was placed into a plastic overflow container. Water wasallowed to fill BOD bottle from the bottom into the overflowcontainer. The stopper was held in the overflow container to berinsed. Once water started to flow out of the overflow container theoverflow container/BOD bottle was moved down so the viton tubing cameout and the bottle was stoppered under water while still in theoverflow container. A plastic cap was snapped on to hold the stopperin place. One duplicate sample was taken on every other station fromrandom Niskin bottles. Air samples, pumped into the system using anAir Cadet pump from a Dekoron air intake hose mounted high on theforemast, were run when time permitted. Air measurements are used as acheck on accuracy.10.2  Equipment and TechniqueCFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and SF6 were measured on 78 0f 83 stationsfor a total of 2100 samples. Salt water flooded the analytical systemjust after sampling station 76, which caused us to not analyzingsamples from Stations 75, 77, 78, 79, and 81. Analyses were performedon a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an electron capture detector(ECD). Samples were introduced into the GC-EDC via a purge and dualtrap system. 202 ml water samples were purged with nitrogen and thecompounds of interest were trapped on a main Porapack N/Carboxen 1000trap held at ~ -20°C with a Vortec Tube cooler. After the sample hadbeen purged and trapped for 6 minutes at 250ml/min flow, the gasstream was stripped of any water vapor via a magnesium perchloratetrap prior to transfer to the main trap. The main trap was isolatedand heated by direct resistance to 150°C. The desorbed contents of themain trap were back-flushed and transferred, with helium gas, over ashort period of time, to a small volume focus trap in order to improvechromatographic peak shape. The focus trap was Porapak N and is heldat ~ -20°C with a Vortec Tube cooler. The focus trap was flash heatedby direct resistance to 180°C to release the compounds of interestonto the analytical pre-columns. The first precolumn was a 5 cm lengthof 1/16" tubing packed with 80/100 mesh molecular sieve 5A. Thiscolumn was used to hold back N2O and keep it from entering the maincolumn. The second pre-column was the first 5 meters of a 60 m Gasprocapillary column with the main column consisting of the remaining 55meters. The analytical pre-columns were held in-line with the mainanalytical column for the first 50 seconds of the chromatographic run.After 35 seconds, all of the compounds of interest were on the maincolumn and the pre-column was switched out of line and back-flushedwith a relatively high flow of nitrogen gas. This prevented latereluting compounds from building up on the analytical column,eventually eluting and causing the detector baseline signal toincrease.The samples were stored at room temperature and analyzed within 24hours of collection. Every 12 to 18 measurements were followed by apurge blank and a standard. The surface sample was held aftermeasurement and was sent through the process in order to "restrip" itto determine the efficiency of the purging process.10.3  CalibrationA gas phase standard, 33780, was used for calibration. Theconcentrations of the compounds in this standard are reported on theSIO 2005 absolute calibration scale. 5 calibration curves were runover the course of the cruise. Estimated accuracy is ±2%. Precisionfor CFC-12, CFC-11, CFC-113 and SF6 was less than 2%. Estimated limitof detection is 1 fmol/kg for CFC-11, 3 fmol/kg for CFC-12 andCFC-113, and 0.05 fmol/kg for SF6.11  UNDERWAY pCO2 ANALYSISPI’s   * Rik Wanninkhof (NOAA/AOML)   * Richard A. Feely (NOAA/PMEL)Technicians   * Charles Featherstone (NOAA/AOML)   * Dana Greeley (NOAA/PMEL)An automated underway pCO2 system from AOML was installed in theHydro Lab of the RV Roger Revelle. The design of the instrumentalsystem is based on Wanninkhof and Thoning [Wanninkhof1993] and Feelyet al. [Feely1998], while the details of the instrument and of thedata processing are described in Pierrot, et.al. [Pierrot2009].The repeating cycle of the system included 4 gas standards, 5 ambientair samples, and 100 headspace samples from its equilibrator every 3hours. The concentrations of the standards range from 233 to 463 ppmCO2 in compressed air. These field standards were calibrated withprimary standards that are directly traceable to the WMO scale. A gascylinder of ultra-high purity air was used every 18 hours to set thezero of the analyzer.The system included an equilibrator where approximately 0.6 liters ofconstantly refreshed surface seawater from the bow or mid-ship intakewas equilibrated with 0.8 liters of gaseous headspace. The water flowrate through the equilibrator was 1.5 to 2.2 liters/min.The equilibrator headspace was circulated through a non-dispersiveinfrared (IR) analyzer, a LI-COR™ 6262, at 50 to 120 ml/min and thenreturned to the equilibrator. When ambient air or standard gases wereanalyzed, the gas leaving the analyzer was vented to the lab. A KNFpump constantly pulled 6-8 liter/min of marine air through 100 m of0.95 cm (= 3/8") OD Dekoron™ tubing from an intake on the bow mast.The intake had a rain guard and a filter of glass wool to preventwater and larger particles from contaminating the intake line andreaching the pump. The headspace gas and marine air were dried beforeflushing the IR analyzer.A custom program developed using LabView™ controlled the system andgraphically displayed the air and water results. The program recordedthe output of the IR analyzer, the GPS position, water and gas flows,water and air temperatures, internal and external pressures, and avariety of other sensors. The program recorded all of these data foreach analysis.The automated pCO2 analytical system had several issues during thecruise with the seawater intakes:1.

A total of 864 60 ml plastic bottles were used to collect40 ml samples according to the protocol provided. Items in italics inthe description below indicate an action that was not specificallyindicated in the protocol.1. The sample bottles came stored in annotated postal boxes   (15x25x10 cm); with the annotation corresponding to the labels of   the bottles inside; e.g. MPI 2016 Haug SO 00001 to 00049.2. The container with the empty sample bottles and documentation   was kept in the forward bio-lab. Usual before the return of the CTD   to the deck, but sometimes afterward, the 24 bottle plastic rack   was filled with the empty bottles. *To keep out the light, the   bottles were covered with a black towel. Because timing was not   always optimum, the black towel was kept over the sample bottles in   the tray at all times prior to storage.*3. Seawater was taken directly from the Bullister bottles. Sample   bottles were rinsed 3 times with seawater from the Bullister prior   to sampling. Each 60 ml sample bottle was filled with approximately   40 ml of seawater.4. After sample 24 bottles were filled they were placed in their   corresponding postal boxes and placed directly in the dark in a   -20°C freezer[2].5. The sample ID’s, Bullister bottle numbers and date were recorded   on the log sheet provided. After all sampling was complete this log   sheet was converted to the electronic version, also provided.The original sample plan asked for 24 stations x 36 bottles between66°S and 38°S sampling every third station (using sampling scheme II).Assuming 30 nm spacing this would provide 1.0 to 1.2 degree (~90 nm)spacing. As we were limited by extended station spacing and when thesamples could be taken (i.e. only the night-shift had the availablemanpower) the actual station sampling was less regular than theinitial plan. Full profiles with samples from all available Bullisterbottles were taken at 26 stations for a total of 851 samples. Stationspacing ranged from 36 to 150 nm with an average of 97 nmcovering latitudes 66.3°S to 23.3°S.Table 12.1: Table of Nitrate Nitrogen Isotope Samples   Stn   |    #    |     ID#s      | Latitude | Longitude | Dist to Next          | Samples |               |   (°N)   |    (°E)    | Profile (nm) =========================================================================    5    |    34   | 00001 - 00034 | -66.3    |   78.125  |     80.8     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------    8    |    36   | 00035 - 00070 | -65.1    |   79.607  |    140.8     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   12    |    31   | 00071 - 00101 | -63.003  |   82.01   |     90.2     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   15    |    27   | 00102 - 00128 | -61.5    |   82      |    120       ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   19    |    25   | 00129 - 00153 | -59.5    |   82      |    120.3     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   25    |    36   | 00154 - 00188 | -57.513  |   82.523  |     74       ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   28    |    36   | 00189 - 00224 | -56.484  |   83.77   |    120.4     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   32    |    36   | 00225 - 00260 | -54.786  |   85.664  |     89.4     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   35    |    36   | 00261 - 00296 | -53.526  |   87.024  |     68.5     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   37    |    28   | 00297 - 00324 | -52.531  |   87.954  |    103.5     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   40    |    35   | 00325 - 00359 | -51.037  |   89.35   |    104.4     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   43    |    36   | 00360 - 00395 | -49.543  |   90.747  |    140.5     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   47    |    35   | 00396 - 00430 | -47.551  |   92.609  |    142.1     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   51    |    34   | 00431 - 00464 | -45.559  |   94.47   |    151.2     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   55    |    34   | 00465 - 00498 | -43.068  |   95      |    115.4     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   58    |    36   | 00499 - 00534 | -41.144  |   95      |    129.2     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   62    |    36   | 00535 - 00570 | -38.991  |   94.992  |     59.5     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   64    |    36   | 00571 - 00606 | -37.999  |   95.004  |     90.1     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   67    |    36   | 00607 - 00642 | -36.498  |   95.003  |     89.8     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   70    |    25   | 00643 - 00677 | -35.001  |   95.002  |     89.6     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   73    |    36   | 00678 - 00713 | -33.508  |   95.001  |     90       ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   76    |    36   | 00714 - 00748 | -32.009  |   95.013  |     78.6     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   79    |    24   | 00747 - 00772 | -30.699  |   95.004  |     71       ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   81    |    27   | 00773 - 00799 | -29.515  |   95.006  |     36.2     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   82    |    27   | 00800 - 00826 | -28.911  |   95.002  |     35.6     ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+--------------   83    |    33   | 00827 - 00830,| -28.318  |   95.009  |                       |         | 00841 - 00864 |          |           |              ---------+---------+---------------+----------+-----------+-------------- Total   |   851   |               |          |           |               Samples [2] On March 6th the engineers discovered that the walk-in freezer    where the sample boxes were being stored had failed. The    temperature had risen to -10.5°C by the time the samples were    moved in their boxes (16:00 – 16:15 UTC) to an unused freezer in    the science hold (temperature in this freezer was set to -20°C).13  ∆18O SAMPLINGPIs   * Peter Schlosser (LDEO)   * Lynne Talley (SIO)Samples for ∆18O were taken by the CTD-watch for Schlosser andTalley. A total of 1073 brown glass bottles were used to collect XX mlsamples according to the protocol provided.1. The sample bottles came stored in annotated boxes that were each   labeled with a box number (1-20) as it was filled samples.2. The container with the empty sample bottles and documentation   was kept in the forward bio-lab. Before the return of the CTD to   the deck, 36 bottles were prepared with Bullister bottle numbers   written in the caps. The 24 bottle plastic rack, which sat in a   plastic basin (both provided) was filled with the empty bottles.   The 12 extra bottles were placed upright in the basin.3. Seawater was taken directly from the Bullister bottles using the   tube provided. Sample bottles were rinsed once with seawater from   the Bullister prior to sampling.4. After sampling the 36 bottles were taken back to the forward   bio- lab where they were dried with paper towels, caps were   tightened and wrapped in tape, and labels were filled out and   applied.5. The sample ID’s, Bullister bottle numbers, date and box number   were recorded on a log sheet provided. After all sampling was   complete this log sheet was converted to the electronic version,   which will be sent to the PIs.The agreed upon sampling plan followed the basic outline of the I06Ssampling provided by Robert Key (Princeton) with concentrated samplingat the southernmost stations and less concentrated to the north. Thetable below summarizes the sampling.Note: Note there was a mix up in the assigning ID numbers so there      are IDs 432A, B and C and 452A, and B.          | dO18  | dO18 | STA |      |

Global CDOM Group* Norman Nelson, Earth Research Institute UCSB, PI* Cara Nissen, ETH-Zürich, Volunteer Graduate Student14.1  Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)Sampling: We nominally sampled one cast per day, on the cast nearestthe overpass times of the ocean color instrument bearing satellitesAqua (MODIS) and NPP (VIIRS). Each Niskin bottle would be sampled,with two randomly selected replicates.Preparation: The standard method involves collecting 60 mL samplesinto glass EPA vials, then filtering the samples at low vacuumpressure (-0.05 MPa) through 25mm 0.2 micron Nuclepore filters whichhave been preconditioned with ultrapure water to remove organiccontaminants. For the underway samples we used 0.2 micron nylonZenPure cartridge filters to remove particles. Sample vials are rinsedwith the filtrate and the filtrate is returned to the vial. Filteredsamples are stored at 4°C until analysis ([Nelson2007], [Nelson2009]).Original plan was to analyze samples at sea using the WPI UltraPath200cm liquid waveguide cell spectrophotometer system. However the celldeveloped an air leak that I could not correct, so we opted to collectsamples to return to UCSB for analysis on a functioning system ratherthan fight the heisenbug in the cell. We collected 16 samples and tworeplicates on each cast, filtered and stored them. The plan is toreturn the samples to UCSB from Fremantle.We collected samples on 21 stations, for a total of 334 samples and 40replicates.Analysis: Filtered seawater samples are analyzed for absorption in the250-734 nm range using a WPI UltraPath spectrophotometer system. TheUltraPath is a single-beam spectrophotometer system consisting of aUV-Visible light source, a 200 cm liquid waveguide cell, and a diodearray spectrometer. Samples (appx. 12 mL volume) are injected into thecell using a peristaltic pump. Light is introduced to the cell via afiber-optic and travels the length of the cell because of totalinternal reflection, as in a fiber optic filament. Absorbance iscalculated by computing the logarithm of the spectrum of transmittedlight through a sample divided by the spectrum of transmitted lightthrough a reference solution (in this case ultrapure water preparedeach day with our Barnstead Nanopure Diamond UV system using potablewater as input). Because of the difference in real refractive indexbetween seawater and ultrapure water the raw data have an apparentnegative absorbance signal that must be removed before computingabsorption coefficient (m^-1) (as absorbance x 2.303/l, where l is theeffective pathlength of the cell, [Nelson2007]).On this expedition we are testing a new protocol for CDOM absorptionspectra measurement and refractive index correction as part of a NASAmethodological development effort. The protocol involves measuringstandard solutions of Suwanee River Fulvic Acid ~0.25 mg/L and sodiumchloride at 30 and 40 g/L to monitor instrument performance and obtaindata for correction of apparent absorption due to refractivedifferences between ultrapure water and seawater.Selected CDOM absorption data from discrete wavelengths will besubmitted to CCHDO upon completion of quality control. More completedata sets including raw data and processing code will be available viathe NASA bio-optical field data SeaBASS (seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov).14.2  Chlorophyll aSampling: We collected ~500mL samples from the top 6 depths (usually~200m), one cast daily, total of approximately 126 samples.Preparation: Samples were collected into 500mL brown HDPE bottles andwere subsequently filtered onto 25mm 0.45μm pore nitrocellulosefilters. The filters were placed in polypropylene Falcon tubes andextracted 48 hours at 4°C temperature in 10 mL of 90% acetone (withBarnstead Nanopure UV prepared water); and were shaken after 24 hoursto ensure complete filter dissolution.Analysis: The acetone extracts were analyzed using the acidificationtechnique [Mueller2003] on a Turner Designs AU-10 fluorometer with thestandard chlorophyll fluorescence set. The fluorescence (in relativeunits) was measured before (Rb) and after (Ra) acidification with twodrops of 10% HCl. Chlorophylla was computed according to the standardformula:            Chla(µg/l) = (τ/τ - 1)Fd(Rb) – (Ra)Where τis the fluorescence ratio of pure chlorophyll a to purephaeophytin a and Fd is the calibration coefficient (μg/L). τandFd for each of the three sensitivity ranges of the instrument weredetermined in August 2014 by Janice Jones and Nathalie Guillocheau,UCSB; using solutions of pure Anacystis nidulans chlorophyll a (Sigma)in 90% acetone.HIGH Tau =       | 1.9539-----------------+-------MED Tau =        | 1.9496-----------------+-------LOW Tau =        | 1.8885-----------------+-------Med/High Tau =   | 1.9520-----------------+-------Low/Med Tau =    | 1.9274-----------------+-------overallavg Tau = | 1.9393               | [Chla] Rb   | [Chla] ((τ/(τ-1)) |   Slope                |             |     *(Rb-Ra))     |            ==============================================================HIGH Fd =      | 0.138925422 |    0.138925422    | 0.142718147---------------+-------------+-------------------+------------MED Fd =       | 0.138626676 |    0.138626676    | 0.141249987---------------+-------------+-------------------+------------LOW Fd =       | 0.126879138 |    0.126879138    | 0.128316741---------------+-------------+-------------------+------------Med/High Fd =  | 0.1388      |    0.138794721    | 0.141417549---------------+-------------+-------------------+------------Low/Med Fd =   | 0.1344      |    0.134354844    | 0.141000945---------------+-------------+-------------------+------------overallavgFd = | 0.1364      |    0.136411604    | 0.141201691Instrument performance was checked daily with a Turner Designs solidfluorescence standard. No apparent trend was observed.Preliminary Results: Preliminary quality control based on phaeophytina to chlorophyll a ratios suggest almost all samples collected to datefrom shallower than 200m were good. Samples collected at 200m andbelow were effectively zero in most cases, putting a tentative lowerlimit for chlorophyll determination at 0.01 mg/m^3. Results show theexpected high latitude shoaling and formation of a subsurfacechlorophyll maximum in the subtropics. Surface chlorophyllconcentrations at the surface at the northernmost part of the transectwere below 0.04 milligrams per cubic meter, amongst the lowestconcentrations of chlorophyll found in the ocean.Problems: Two samples were possibly acid-contaminated and resulted innegative computed chlorophyll concentrations (flagged 4). One sampleextract was too concentrated for the fluorometer sensitivity (station010/1 sample 34) and the extract was diluted by 50% to get it in range(flagged 3). Four other samples were flagged as 3 because they didn’tfit in the profile.All collected CHLORA data were reported to CCHDO during the cruise.Additional data and raw data will be submitted to the NASA bio-opticalfield database SeaBASS (seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov).Fig. 14.1: Chlorophyll a profiles from Station 2 (65.6S), Station 31           (55.1S) and station 81 (29.5S).14.3  CDOM Rosette FluorometerEquipment and Techniques: We deployed WETLabs ECO CDOM 6000mfluorometer FLCDRTD s/n 3117 on the rosette at the outset of thecruise. This was a replacement for a similar instrument that was lostwith the rosette on Leg 1 of A16N in 2013. This instrument excitesfluorescence with a 380 nm UV light source and monitors fluorescenceat 420 nm.Sampling and Analysis: Instrument data are saved as analog volts DCand are vicariously calibrated post cruise using laboratory-measuredfluorescence spectra standardized to quinine sulfate fluorescenceequivalents (ppb) of archived samples using a Horiba Jobin YvonFluoromax-4 ([Nelson2009], [Nelson2016]).Problems: The instrument suffered from data noise and an offset thatoccurred between 1200 and 1500 db pressure on each cast. This issimilar to problems that occurred with the instrument on the A16S andP16N sections. Since those cruises the instrument returned to WETLabsfor evaluation and they could find no problem with the instrument. Thesame problems occurred with different cables and different SeaBird CTDunits, so the problem had to rest with the fluorometer itself. Icurrently suspect a mechanical issue, related to pressure, on theoptical face of the instrument. This problem was encountered in theprototype fluorometer we first deployed in 2006, and apparently hasreturned.The instrument was lost with the rosette on 22 February, so themystery will remain unsolved.14.4  Spectroradiometer castsAcquisition: Each day near local noon (with one exception; see below)we deployed a Biospherical C-OPS profiling spectroradiometer system(system 023) off the port quarter. The instrument measures downwellingirradiance and upwelling radiance in 19 channels stretching from theUV-B to the NIR wavebands. The system includes a surface referenceunit with matching channels and a shadowband system for measuringdirect and diffuse contributions to total irradiance. All instrumentsacquire data at 15 Hz. The profiler is hand deployed and recovered toallow drift away from the ship to avoid shadow influence. The maximumdepth reached on every profile was approximately 100 m.Data Processing: Collected data are subjected to quality control fortilt and surface irradiance change during the profile [Mueller2003]and derived products include attenuation coefficient spectra andwater-leaving radiance reflectance (for ocean color remote sensingdata validation). Resulting products will be made available via NASA’sfield bio-optics archive SeaBASS (seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov).   C-OPS cast summary to 02/29/16   Station 002/1   Cast Start: 19-Feb-2016 08:12:40 UT   Cast End  : 19-Feb-2016 08:26:45 UT   Max Depth : 55.1 m   Station 007/1   Cast Start: 20-Feb-2016 08:46:04 UT   Cast End  : 20-Feb-2016 09:04:27 UT   Max Depth : 124.6 m   Station 010/2   Cast Start: 21-Feb-2016 08:56:55 UT   Cast End  : 21-Feb-2016 09:19:13 UT   Max Depth : 120.8 m   Station 014/1   Cast Start: 22-Feb-2016 08:13:07 UT   Cast End  : 22-Feb-2016 08:32:05 UT   Max Depth : 118.1 m   Station 017/1   Cast Start: 23-Feb-2016 07:21:14 UT   Cast End  : 23-Feb-2016 07:36:35 UT   Max Depth : 117.8 m   Station 023/2   Cast Start: 24-Feb-2016 07:15:41 UT   Cast End  : 24-Feb-2016 07:31:44 UT   Max Depth : 98.2 m   Station 027/1   Cast Start: 25-Feb-2016 08:24:17 UT   Cast End  : 25-Feb-2016 08:38:27 UT   Max Depth : 85.3 m   Station 030/1   Abort (wind 33 kts)   *period of joyful weather here*   Station 042/1   Cast Start: 01-Mar-2016 08:33:36 UT   Cast End  : 01-Mar-2016 08:49:04 UT   Max Depth : 100.4 m   Station 045/2   Abort heavy current and high ship thrust   Station 049/2   Cast Start: 03-Mar-2016 07:53:19 UT   Cast End  : 03-Mar-2016 08:07:55 UT   Max Depth : 111.3 m   Cast 053/2   Cast Start: 04-Mar-2016 08:16:20 UT   Cast End  : 04-Mar-2016 08:30:35 UT   Max Depth : 114.7 m   Cast 057/2   Cast Start: 05-Mar-2016 09:52:55 UT   Cast End  : 05-Mar-2016 10:08:23 UT   Max Depth : 91.5 m   Cast 060/2   Cast Start: 06-Mar-2016 06:36:46 UT   Cast End  : 06-Mar-2016 06:52:50 UT   Max Depth : 111.0 m   Cast 065/1   Cast Start: 07-Mar-2016 08:38:21 UT   Cast End  : 07-Mar-2016 08:52:15 UT   Max Depth : 109.7 m   Cast 068/2   Cast Start: 08-Mar-2016 07:28:36 UT   Cast End  : 08-Mar-2016 07:44:22 UT   Max Depth : 85.8 m   Cast 072/1   Cast Start: 09-Mar-2016 06:20:04 UT   Cast End  : 09-Mar-2016 06:33:40 UT   Max Depth : 100.6 m   Cast 076/1   Cast Start: 10-Mar-2016 07:23:14 UT   Cast End  : 10-Mar-2016 07:37:22 UT   Max Depth : 104.9 m   Cast 081/1   Cast Start: 11-Mar-2016 08:47:13 UT   Cast End  : 11-Mar-2016 09:01:23 UT   Max Depth : 102.1 mProblems: Several profiles shallow due to strong sub surface currents.Twisting in the cable was encountered during several of the castswhich could be attributed to currents or the rate at which line waspaid out.At the outset of the cruise we had difficulty with the surfaceshadowband system. Apparently the temperature was too cold foreffective stepper motor operation. We were able to correct thisproblem by increasing the working and rest voltages.Fig. 14.2: C-OPS            443 nm downwelling irradiance (top left) and upwelling radiance            (lower left), station 7, cast 1. 443 nm surface irradiance            collected at the same moment is shown in cyan. Surface unit (ship)            and profiler tilt and roll are shown in the righthand panels. The            dip in the profiles near 100m is caused by a cloud passage, as can            be seen in the surface reference data. Strong curvature in the            profiles (shown on a logarithmic scale) are due to the presence of            a chlorophyll maximum near 40m.14.5  Underway optics systemEquipment and Techniques: We installed our underway inherent opticalproperty measuring system in the hydro lab and supplied it with ship’suncontaminated seawater at appx 10 L/min. The system includes acomputer-controlled valve that switches between whole water and a 0.2μm filter (ZenPure nylon cartridge) which feeds an MSRC vortexdebubbler. The debubbled water is supplied through a PVC manifold to aSeaBird TSG and an array of optical instruments: a WETLabs ECO BB3backscattering sensor installed in a custom light trap [Slade2010], aWETLabs AC-S hyperspectral absorption and attenuation meter, a SequoiaScientific LISST 100X type B laser diffraction particle counter/sizer,and a Satlantic in-situ FIRe in vivo fluorescenceexcitation/relaxation sensor.Fig. 14.3: Particulate backscattering coefficient from the southernmost           end of the transit and beginning of the section.           Note near exact overlap of the section south of 66.3SAnalysis: The system includes a computer-controlled data acquisitionsystem that automatically switches between filtered and whole watersupply to the instruments on a user-defined schedule. The filteredseawater baseline is used to correct the instrument data forcalibration and offset drift, variable CDOM, and temperature effects[Slade2010]. With the system operating in unfiltered mode theinstruments are sampled at 1 Hz and data are generally collected inone minute bins. It takes around 15 minutes to completely flush thesystem following a switch two or from filter mode, so no datacollection takes place during this time period. Approximately five“filter” periods are scheduled each day. Instruments are also poweredoff for one minute in ten to mitigate overheating and to extend lamplife.System optics were cleaned each day using isopropanol and the filtercartridge was changed on alternate days.Data from the system require extensive post processing and qualitycontrol, which will be performed on land. Resulting data will be madeavailable via NASA’s field bio-optics archive SeaBASS (seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov).14.6  SOCCOM samplingSampling: The ODF group collected samples for POC and HPLCphytoplankton pigment analysis on stations where SOCCOM bio-opticalfloats were deployed. ODF used our large volume HPLC/AP/POC filtrationrig to filter the samples and the samples were stored in our liquidnitrogen Dewar during the cruise. We collected ~2 L samples intopolyethylene sample bottles from the surface and chlorophyll maximumdepths at each cast. Information on SOCCOM float deployments andsample collection is available elsewhere in the cruise report.Preparation: Samples were filtered onto precombusted 25 mm GF/F glassfiber filters at <-0.05 MPa vacuum pressure. The filters were foldedinto foil packets and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thesamples will be returned to UCSB via liquid nitrogen dry shipper.Analysis: POC samples will be analyzed for C and N content at the UCSBMarine Science Institute Analytical Laboratory. Samples are acidified,combusted at 100 °C and analyzed using a Control Equipment, Inc.CEC440HA elemental analyzer (http://msi.ucsb.edu/services/analytical-lab/instruments/organic-elemental-analyzer-chn). Detection limits areapproximately 2 μg carbon and 5 μg nitrogen.HPLC samples will be analyzed by Crystal Thomas at the NASA GoddardSpaceflight Center HPLC lab (Greenbelt, MD). The full suite ofmeasurements, procedures, and quality control information is availableat: http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/14.7  Phytoplankton Pigments and Particulate AbsorptionSampling: Once daily, in approximate synchronization with our C-OPScasts and satellite overpasses we collected samples from the ship'suncontaminated seawater supply for shore analysis of phytoplanktonpigments via HPLC and for particulate absorption spectra (AP). ~2 Lsamples were collected into polyethylene sample bottles.Preparation: Samples were filtered onto 25 mm GF/F glass fiber filtersand frozen in liquid nitrogen [Mueller2003]. The samples will bereturned for analysis to UCSB (AP) and to NASA GSFC (HPLC).Analysis: Particulate absorption spectra of the AP sample filters aremeasured a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer with an integratingsphere attachment, using a moistened GF/F filter as a blank.Absorbance of filters is converted to absorption coefficient spectrausing the Quantitative Filter Technique [Mueller2003] using multiplescattering corrections developed by Nelson et al. [Nelson1998].Samples for phytoplankton pigment analysis will be analyzed at NASAGSFC by the Ocean Ecology Laboratory Field Support Group(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/hplc/). Acetone extracts of theparticles collected on GF/F filters will be separated using an HP HPLCsystem with a C8 column, and detected using a diode arrayspectrophotometer system to confirm pigment identity. Resulting datawill be made available via NASA’s field bio-optics archive SeaBASS(seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov).[Mueller2003] Mueller, J.L., G.S Fargion, and C.R.              McClain (eds), 2003.

A totalof 1415 samples were collected from 43 stations. At each sampledstation, one duplicate sample was taken from a random depth. Samplesfrom 500m and shallower in the water column were filtered through a47mm in-line GF/F filter. All samples were rinsed 3 times withseawater, collected in 40 mL glass EPA vials, and stored at 4°C. 65µlof 4N Hydrochloric acid were added to preserve samples.Sample vials were prepared for this cruise by soaking in 10%Hydrochloric acid, followed by 3 times rinse with DI water. The vialswere then combusted at 450°C for 4 hours to remove any organic matter.Vial caps were cleaned by soaking in DI water overnight, followed by a3 times rinse, and then left out to air dry.Sampling goals for this cruise were to continue long term monitoringof DOC distribution throughout the water column, in order to helpbetter understand biogeochemical cycling in global oceans.16  LADCPLADCP data were collected during CTD casts, stations 1-13 and 28-83During stations 1-13 a dual head system was used consisting of adownlooker and an uplooker. From station 14-27 no data was collecteddue to loss of the CTD package at station 14. During stations 28-83only a downlooker was available. Preliminary processing was performedonboard. All profiles were sent to A. Thurnherr for shore-basedprocessing. A full QC will be carried out after the cruise.The ADCPs and a lead acid battery pack were affixed to the CTDpackage. Three different ADCP WH300 instruments were used during thecruise.              Stations | DownLooker    | UpLooker                     ==========================================              1 - 13   | WH300 sn: 149 | WH300 sn: 13330              ---------+---------------+----------------              14 - 27  |               |                              ---------+---------------+----------------              28 - 83  | WH300 sn: 150 |                At the start of station 14 the package was lost. The secondary packagewas readied and deployed after a several hour delay. The backup LADCPwas not installed until station 28, downlooker only. Compass problemswithin the unit from station 28 resulted in poor data. On station 59the termination slipped and the package struck the side rail. Theimpact resulted in the compass to function properly.ADCP programming and data acquisition were carried out using the LDEOacquire software running on a Mac computer.Post-cruise processing is necessary and will be conducted at LDEO. Atthat point it will be determined which profiles are of sufficientquality for inclusion in the final CLIVAR ADCP archives.17  Chipods17.1  System Configuration and SamplingInitially, four Chipods were mounted on the rosette to measuretemperature (T), its time derivative (dT/dt), and x and z (horizontaland vertical) accelerations at a sampling rate of 50 Hz. Two Chipodswere oriented with sensors pointing upwards (circled in green in thefigure below), and are referred to as *uplooking*. The other twopointed downwards and are referred to as *downlooking* (circled inblue at the bottom of the rosette in Figure below). The Chipodpressure case, containing the logger board and batteries, is circledin red in the figures below. Ideally, the chipod sensors need to sensean undisturbed stream of fluid passing over the thermistor tip. Forthis reason the uplooking sensors are mounted as far from the rosetteas possible whilst the downlooking sensors are mounted as close to thebottom of the rosette as possible but still above the base frame so asto not be damaged on deployment and recovery. The downlooking chipodsgenerally obtain better (less noisy) data on the downcast and theuplooking sensors record better data on the upcast. Chipod data wasdownloaded daily or every second day. Raw data was plotted for a quickquality check and to ensure chipods were working correctly. After theprimary rosette was lost, three backup chipod loggers were installedon the backup rosette (one downlooking and two uplooking). Thisconfiguration is shown in Chipod Figure 2.Fig.17.1: Chipod Figure 1Fig.17.2: Chipod Figure 217.2  Data Collection and Equipment ChangesA summary of the Chipod logger serial numbers, their associated sensorserial numbers and the station/cast range for which data was collectedis provided in Table 1. In total, data from 66 stations was recordedby two uplooking Chipods whilst data from 9 stations was recorded bytwo downlooking Chipods and data from 53 stations was recorded by onedownlooking Chipod. A more comprehensive summary is provided below.Chipod loggers SN2003 and SN2020 were uplooking and recorded data fromstations 1 to 10 (10 stations). Chipod logger SN2004 was downlookingand recorded data from stations 2 to 10. SN2004 was not logging dataduring the first station. This was rectified for station 2. Chipodlogger SN2001 was downlooking and recorded data from stations 1 to 10.The last data download for these four chipods was on the 21th Februaryafter station 10. The rosette was lost on 22nd February, duringdeployment at station 14. Data from stations 11 to 13 was recorded byloggers but not downloaded and thus was lost with rosette. No data wascollected by any Chipods during stations 14 to 27. The three remainingChipod loggers were installed on 25th February prior to station 28.SN2002 was downlooking and recorded data from stations 28 to 30 andfrom 35 to 36. For an unknown reason SN2002 did not record any dataduring stations 31 to 34. The temperature derivative signal from thesensor (13-05 D) on SN2002 became noisy on 3rd March at approximately10:00 UTC time. Sensor was swapped for 14-32 D on 8th March. Thisimproved the noise signal in dT/dt data. SN2009 and SN1013 were bothuplooking and recorded data from stations 28 to 83. The pole on whichthe uplooking sensors were mounted, was hit by the hangar door onrecovery at station 33. The pole was bent outwards and for station 34which means the sensors were not mounted vertically. This may impactdata quality of SN2009 and SN1013 on that station. The sensors wereremounted on a vertical pole prior to station 35. Sensor cable 24-4-2(connected to SN2009) was caught on the hook during recovery atstation 040 and was torn. Cable was replaced for 24-4-10 and dataquality was not impacted.Table 17.1: Chipod logger data showing serial numbers, orientation of logger             and which stations data was collected from.              | Sensor  |  Sensor  |             |               | NbrChipod Logger | Serial  |  Cable   | Orientation | Station/Cast  | ofSerial Number | Number  |  Serial  |             |     Range     | stns=======================================================================    SN2003    | 11-24 D | 24-04-3  | Uplooking   | 00101 - 01001 |  10 --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN2020    | 14-28 D | 24-06-1  | Uplooking   | 00101 - 01001 |  10 --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN2004    | 13-02 D | 24-06-7  | Downlooking | 00201 - 01001 |   9 --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN2001    | 10-01MP | 24-06-19 | Downlooking | 00101 - 01001 |  10 --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN2002    | 13-05 D | 24-06-19 | Downlooking | 02801 - 03001 |  37               |         |          |             | 03501 - 06801 |     --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN2002    | 14-32 D | 24-6-19  | Downlooking | 06901 - 08301 |  15 --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN2009    | 11-25 D | 24-04-2  | Uplooking   | 02801 - 04001 |  13 --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN2009    | 11-25 D | 24-04-10 | Uplooking   | 04101 - 08301 |  43 --------------+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-----    SN1013    | 14-34 D | 24-04-11 | Uplooking   | 02801 - 08301 |  56 18  STUDENT STATEMENTSSarah Bercovici   [image]On the GO-SHIP I08S cruise, I was the student assistant for the onboard analysis of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and sulfur hexafluoride(SF6), working for Jim Happell and Charlene Grall. As the CFCassistant, I learned technical and analytical skills, such as how tosample for CFCs on the CTD and how to run the samples on the gaschromatographer. I additionally was taught by my supervisors torecognize which compound was which on the resultant gas chromatogram,which allowed me to view trends in the data. From the large amount ofdata we were generating daily, I witnessed the ventilation of thedifferent water masses near the Antarctic shelf slope and in theSouthern Ocean. For example, I saw an increase of CFCs in the newlyformed Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) near the Amery shelf slope, whilethere were substantially less CFCs in the overlying circumpolarwaters. These trends show that AABW has had more recent contact withthe atmosphere (i.e. it shows that this AABW was derived from mostlikely the nearby Antarctic shelf waters). Through observing the data,I also recognized where intermediate and mode waters were being formednear the Polar Front, due to an influx of CFCs reaching down around1000 m depth. I additionally saw that CFC concentrations in thesurface waters south of the Polar Front were much higher than those aswe reached lower latitudes due to the solubility of gases in thecolder waters. Overall, running CFCs in the Southern Ocean was arewarding experience that taught me about the exciting processes thatare occurring in this remote region of the world.In addition to being the CFC student assistant, I collected samplesfor radiocarbon of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is a studentproject that I proposed for this cruise. I brought enough bottles forfour 12-point profiles, and chose to space the profiles out evenlythroughout the transect at approximately 55°S, 45°S, 35°S, and 28°S(see 14C-DOC cruise report for exact sampling locations). This spacingis observed in the dashed lines on the figure below (data on figure isfrom the previous occupation of I08S) and will give a goodrepresentation of the different water masses present, includingcapturing the northward flowing lower circumpolar deep water (LCDW)/AABW which fills the basin of the Indian Ocean; and the southwardflowing Indian Deep Water (IDW), derived from the mixing of upwelledLCDW with the anoxic intermediate waters near the bay of Bengal (asseen in the high apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) signature of IDW inthe figure below). These samples will be analyzed soon on shore usingaccelerator mass spectrometry.   [image]18.2  Hannah Dawson   [image]I’ve had a fantastic time participating in the 2016 occupation of I08Son the Revelle. It’s been a great introduction to life at sea and in-the-field data collection. On this particular cruise I participated asa CTD watch-stander and chipod tech. The CTD watch-stander jobinvolved prepping the rosette, operating the computer console duringcasts and taking water samples for various analyses includingsalinity, radiocarbon and δO18 isotope content. My other role involveddownloading data from chipod instruments and providing maintenancewhere needed. Overall, the experience was a fantastic one with manyhighs and of course some lows.We spent over a week transiting south to our first station just insidethe Antarctic Circle. This was the first time I’d been on a ship inthe open ocean for a long period of time and we had some rough weatherwhich made the adjustment really tough. From the time we crossed 60°Showever, everything improved (or perhaps I just became more accustomedto the rolling ocean...). We started to see an incredible array ofwildlife including seabirds, whales and penguins. Seeing ice bergsinside the Antarctic Circle was really exciting and watching theAurora Australis from the bridge of the ship was definitely ahighlight for me. Another one of my favourite moments was watching thegiant albatross glide over the ocean waves without ever seeming toflap their wings.Early on in the trip we lost the first rosette to the depths of theocean. It was a pretty sad day but everyone on shift banded togetherand we had the backup one working and were on our way again, less than8 hours later. Losing a rosette is not an experience that I’m eager torepeat but it was great to see everyone working together and itdefinitely solidified friendships. My fellow CTD watch-standers,scientists and crew members were fantastic people to be onboard a shipwith. I really enjoyed meeting people from different universities allover the world and it was great to learn about the various researchinterests of everyone on board and how different samples are taken andanalysed. It’s been a great trip and I’m looking forward to the nextopportunity to partake in a research cruise.18.3  Natalie FreemanWhat an amazing time I’ve had aboard the Revelle! These 6 weeks haveflown by, full of experiences that far exceeded my expectations. As aCTD watch-stander, my 12-hour shifts were filled with a mix of hardwork interspersed with moments of overwhelming appreciation of mysurreal circumstances and surroundings. The thrilling anxiety thatcomes with playing 'sample cop' amid the backdrop of a sunrise inshades of pink and blue I had never seen before! Trying to keep pacewith sampling for salts, alkalinity, nitrates, radiocarbon, and/ord18O, bobbing and weaving around others to/from the rosette, but witha near-constant smile from the joking and camaraderie among my fellownight-shifters. The pelting icy rain and gusty winds out on deckfollowed by the satisfaction of tying my first bowline knot and asuccessful 'hook' of the rosette. The necessity of working on variousto-dos from 'back home' after/on top of a 12-hour shift but theexcitement of getting the phone call from the bridge to come witnessthe dancing Aurora Australis! The butterflies during each 'bottomapproach' or the worry of a misfired bottle but taking turns leavingthe console to run out to take pictures of an iceberg or baby shark orpenguin or rainbow or sea snake or flying fish... . Regretting thedecision to go to bed much too late many nights but the elation I feltwhen there was STILL ripe cantaloupe at breakfast (right up until thelast days of the leg!). The constant go-go-go associated with tightlyspaced AND shallow stations and then getting that first real break andfilling it with a quick game of cribbage/quiddler/scrabble, or thatthird cup of tea and a tasty pastry. The shock of losing a rosette tothe sea followed by the unique opportunity to learn more about thebits/bobs, ins/outs of a rosette and getting to do 'deck work' afterall.Most certainly the ups and downs of I08S 2016 have taught me thededication and resilience of the people that appreciate and observeour oceans. Thanks to all science and crew for their kindness andcompany and a special thanks to Alison Macdonald for sharing herwealth of knowledge and experience and helping make my participationpossible. I will surely miss the sea – until next time...18.4  Seth TravisFig. 18.1: During the CTD cast, monitoring the descent of the rosette.           (Photo credit: J. Gum)On this cruise, my primary responsibility was as a CTD watchstander.The tasks required for this position include preparing the rosette fordeployment at roughly half an hour before each cast, monitoring thedescent of the rosette and determining the stopping point for themaximum depth, and firing the rosette bottles during ascent for samplecollection. Due to technical issues, CTD watchstander’s also needed tobe responsible for the guidelines on the rosette during the initialdeployment, as well as hooking the rosette and using the guidelinesduring recovery of the rosette.For my shift (the day shift), I was also responsible for sampling forthe alkalinity group. This was as simple as taking samples on thebottles told to me by the alkalinity group. The sampling consisted oftaking a sample bottle, filling and rinsing the bottle twice withsample water, refilling the bottle, and poisoning the sample withmercuric chloride. After these samples were taken, I helped to takesalinity samples, which simply required me to rinse the sample bottlesthree times, and refill the bottle, leaving just a little head room atthe top of the bottle.Beyond these assigned responsibilities, I also worked to provideupdated maps of wind and wave forecasts, with the current and futureship positions overlaid onto the maps. Once the Matlab program wasdeveloped, which does this task, the daily workload for this wasfairly simple. I simply needed to update the files (forecast maps,completed ship position, proposed ship track) each day, rerun theprogram, and print off a selected forecast map (I usually selected atime for each day which would be close to the change between the dayand night shift).This cruise was my first experience in being part of an extendedresearch cruise. While I have had previous field and ship experience,this was my first of such length. I have definitely gained a greaterappreciation for what goes on during field sampling and processing,and all the pitfalls involved. I now better understand the franticenergy of the situation when problems arise and how a steady hand isneeded to direct that energy towards solving the problems; likewise, Ialso understand the preferred monotony of a smoothly running system. Iwas also able to observe the systems used for measurement and analysisof various oceanic parameters. While I was impressed by the systems, Imust admit that I mostly did not know what each system did, or howthey worked. While I was present for many sample collections, I knewlittle about the actual analysis was, and what happened to thosesamples after.Overall, it has been a positive experience. I learned much aboutseagoing oceanography, the sampling process, all the challenges thatcan arise, and the impressive speed and perseverance of the whole teamto come together to solve those challenges.18.5  David Webb   [image]I've had a great time onboard the Revelle and it has turned into oneof the best experiences of my life. The scenery in itself was amazing;from the southern lights and spectacular sunsets above numerousicebergs, to the range of marine-life surrounding us and encroachingon the ship – including the bird that decided to fly into the back ofmy head when I turned to help deploy the rosette. Disregarding theaesthetically pleasing environment and kamikaze birds, the timeonboard was still an exciting experience. The first week was a littletesting due to the cold that spread, on top of rough seas thatamplified any sea-sickness that was felt. Although after a longtransit of stomach hardening brutality things were only uphill in mypersonal experience.My role on the cruise involved uploading and downloading data from theLADCP instruments sent down with the rosette, as well as standard CTDwatch duties, and collection of water samples for various analysistesting for properties such as salinity, alkalinity and δO^18 isotopecontent. As a new student to physical oceanography (and being focusedaround modeling), it was great to gain some practical experience inthe field and be a part of the ever so needed data collection whilefacing all the challenges that come with it. The loss of the firstrosette along with numerous issues with the winch and a close callwith the second rosette made for an interesting few weeks. Althoughthese were obviously significant setbacks, it personally enhanced myexperience because we had to adapt to the situation and in the processI have come out learning more than I would have otherwise.Aside from work and scenery, it was a real pleasure to be in ashipmate environment – building strong working relationships andfriendships, all whilst contributing to the larger scientificcommunity. It is definitely something I would recommend and lookforwards to doing again in the future.18.6  Earle Wilson   [image]Photo credit: Cara NissenOn this cruise, I mainly served as a CTD watch stander. In this role,I assisted with all stages of the rosette’s launch, recovery andsampling. I was also the caretaker of six Argo floats, which I helpedto deploy throughout the cruise. Additionally, I maintained a blog(https://floatdispenser.blogspot.com/) where I chronicled the eventsaround me as well as my experiences onboard.Overall, my time onboard the Revelle for the 2016 I08S cruise was anexciting and fulfilling experience. As someone who relies heavily onocean data collected by others, I am thankful for the opportunity towitness and experience the challenges of doing fieldwork at sea. Idon’t think I will ever complain about gaps in my data again!This cruise was not all sunshine and happiness though. There werestretches where we (the CTD watch) had to work long hours, for days onend, while fighting sea sickness and sleep deprivation. But in theend, I think the good overwhelmingly outweighed the bad. Never have Ilearned and accomplished so much over such a short period of time.Even the worst aspects of my experience can be viewed as positives intheir own right. I believe those adversities helped to further mygrowth both as a scientist and as an individual.Of all the things I am grateful for on this cruise, what I willcherish the most are my interactions with the people onboard. Inparticular, I am grateful to have met my fellow CTD watch standers.The bonds and friendships that I developed on this cruise are onesthat I will hold dear for the rest of my life.19  SOCCOM FLOAT DEPLOYMENTOn this cruise, we successfully deployed six [1] Argo floats for theSouthern Ocean Carbon Climate Ocean and Modeling (SOCCOM) project.Each float is equipped with sensors to measure temperature, salinity,oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll and backscatter. With thesemeasurements, we hope to further our understanding of the processesthat contribute to carbon export in the Southern Ocean; this is one ofthe core missions of the SOCCOM project.We released our floats at stations 11, 25, 36, 41, 48 and 56. Theexact time and location of each deployment are summarized in the logtable below. Each deployment was done at the end of their respectiveCTD cast, immediately after the rosette was secured onboard. Welaunched each float by lowering the instrument over the stern of theship as the vessel was moving 1-2 knots over water. Each float wasdeployed with the assistance and supervision of the on-duty res-tech.At each deployment station, we took samples for HPLC and POC analyses.These were 2-liter samples from the surface and the chlorophyllmaximum, with duplicates at the surface (6 liters in total). Thesesamples will be shipped to the US for analysis. Samples for pH,alkalinity, oxygen, salinity, and nutrients (including nitrate) werealso collected and analyzed on-board by personnel from SIO in theDickson lab and STS/ODF. Additionally, DIC samples were collected andanalyzed by personnel from AOML and PMEL.We have now received at least one profile from all of the floats wedeployed on this cruise. These data are preliminary, but each floatappears to be functioning properly. As an example, we haveincluded a plot that compares the first profile from Float 9602 withCTD/bottle data from station 36.We would like to express our gratitude to all the members of thescience party and shipboard crew who facilitated our deployments. Weextend special thanks to chief scientist Alison Macdonald for ensuringthat our floats were deployed within a few nautical miles of theirtarget deployment locations, despite all the delays and setbacks weencountered on this cruise.Fig. 19.1: Float 9602 Comparison   The above plot compares the first profile from the Argo float 9602   with preliminary data from station 36. The plain solid lines   represent the float profiles. The broken blue and green lines show   the temperature and salinity data from the station 36 CTD cast. The   red and magenta lines with circular markers show nitrate and oxygen   concentrations measured from station 36 bottle samples.[1] We had originally planned to deploy seven floats for the    cruise, but one float was deemed "dead on arrival" while we were    in port. This float (UW ID 9642) was shipped back to Seattle prior    to the cruise.Table 19.1: This table summarizes the deployment time and location of each             float.Nominal  | Float | Sensors |  I8S   |      Deployment      |   Lat.  |   Lon.  |    Name   location | UW ID |         | Sta. # |   Date   | Time      |         |         | (deployer) (°S, °E) |       |         | Cast#  |          |           |         |         |           ===========================================================================================63.525S, | 0564  |  IONpF  | 11/02  | Feb. 21, | 16:08 UTC | 63.535S | 82.000E | E.        82.00E   | Navis |         |        | 2016     |           |         |         | Wilson/J.          |       |         |        |          |           |         |         | Manger    ---------+-------+---------+--------+----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------57.61S,  | 0510  |  IONpF  | 25/02  | Feb. 24, | 20:31 UTC | 57.512S | 82.521E | E.

All the plastic wrapping, and only theplastic wrapping, was removed from the drifter. After permission wasobtained from the bridge for deployment, the drifter was then carriedout to the stern. Carrying usually required two people, one of whomwas the res-tech on duty, the other was a member of the CTD watch. Athird person was usually in the lab, ready to take a snapshot of thetabulated GPS display as the drifter was dropped in. The time,position, and estimated height of the drop was then recorded on thelog sheet. The log sheets were return to Shaun Dolk at AOML. At lastword all 10 drifters had reported back.
