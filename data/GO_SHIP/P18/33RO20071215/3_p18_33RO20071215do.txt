SUMMARY

A hydrographic survey (CLIVAR/Carbon P18) was carried out on the NOAA Ship
Ronald H. Brown from December 2007 through February 2008 in the eastern
Pacific.  Most of the survey work was a repeat of a 1994 occupation of a
meridional section nominally along 110 - 103 deg. W (WOCE P18).  Two
stations along a 1992 section along 67 deg. S west of 103 deg. W (WOCE S4P)
were also taken towards the end of the cruise.  Operations included
CTD/LADCP/Rosette casts and radiometer casts.  Underway data collected
included upper-ocean currents from the shipboard ADCP, surface
oceanographic and meteorological parameters from the ship's underway
systems, and bathymetry data.  Ancillary operations included surface
drifter deployments, Argo float deployments, and XBT drops.  NDBC TAO buoy
servicing was also performed during the first leg of the cruise.

After an 8-day delay, NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown departed San Diego, CA on
15 December 2007 at 0215 UTC.  The ship anchored off Easter Island, Chile
from 18-21 January 2008 for a personnel change and short break between leg
1 and leg 2.  CLIVAR/Carbon P18 ended in Punta Arenas, Chile on 23 February
2008.

A total of 174 stations and 7 TAO Buoy sites were occupied during P18.  179
CTD/LADCP/Rosette casts (including 2 Test casts, 2 TAO calibration casts
and 2 casts at station 98: the first to end leg 1 and the second to start
leg 2) plus 54 radiometer casts were made.  24 ARGO floats were deployed,
17 SVP drifters were deployed, and approximately 82 XBTs were dropped.  CTD
data, LADCP data and water samples (up to 36) were collected on most
Rosette casts, in most cases to within 10-20 meters of the bottom.

Salinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrient samples were analyzed for up to 36
water samples from each cast of the principal CTD/LADCP/Rosette program.
Water samples were also measured for CFCs, pCO2, Total CO2 (DIC), Total
Alkalinity, pH, CDOM and Chlorophyll a.  Additional samples were collected
for 3He, Tritium, 13C/14C, 32Si, Millero Density, ONAR, DOC, DON, POC, and
CDOM2C/CDOM3C.



Introduction

A sea-going science team gathered from multiple oceanographic institutions
participated on the cruise.  Several other science programs were supported
with no dedicated cruise participant.  The science team and their
responsibilities are listed below.

DESCRIPTION OF MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES

1.  CTD/HYDROGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS PROGRAM

The basic CTD/hydrographic measurements consisted of salinity, dissolved
oxygen, and nutrient measurements made from water samples taken on rosette
casts; plus pressure, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen,
transmissometer, and fluorometer profiles collected from the CTD.  A total
of 179 CTD/rosette casts were made, usually to within 10-20m of the bottom.
Problems encountered are described later in this documentation.  The
distribution of samples is illustrated in figures 1.0-1.3.

Figure 1.0  Sample distribution, stations 1-54.
Figure 1.1  Sample distribution, stations 54-98/1.
Figure 1.2  Sample distribution, stations 98/2-137.
Figure 1.3  Sample distribution, stations 137-185.


1.1.  Navigation and Bathymetry Data Acquisition

Navigation data were acquired at 2-second intervals from the ship's P-Code
GPS receiver by a Linux system beginning December 15.

Bathymetric data were logged from the ship's 3.5kHz ODEC Bathy 2000
echosounder beginning 22 December 2007 at 2030 UTC.  The echosounder was
turned off during casts, and cast pinger-return data was recorded instead
of bottom depth.  It was usually turned back on between casts.

Raw Seabeam data were also logged from 22 December, but not otherwise
processed.  Seabeam centerbeam depths were displayed continuously, and data
were manually recorded at cast start/bottom/end on CTD Cast Logs.

Both the Seabeam and Bathy 2000 transducers were located on the hull of the
ship, at approximately 5.8m depth.  Ship's Seabeam data recorded during CTD
casts were already corrected for transducer depth, but used 1500m/sec sound
velocity to determine depth. The manually recorded Seabeam depths were
Carter-table corrected via software using actual latitude and longitude
before reporting in data files.

Etopo2 bathymetry data were merged with navigation time-series data after
each cast and used for bottle sections shown earlier in this report.


1.2.  Underwater Electronics Packages

The SBE9plus CTDs were connected to SBE32 carousels (24-place for CTD 209,
36-place for CTD 315), providing for single-conductor sea cable operation.
Within the 0.322 sea cable, two conducting wires were soldered together as
positive and the third conducting wire was used as negative.  The sea cable
armor was not used for ground (return).  Power to the CTDs and sensors,
carousels and altimeters was provided through the sea cable from the
SBE11plus deck unit in the main lab.

CTD data were collected with a Sea-Bird Electronics SBE9plus CTD (PMEL #209
or #315).  The CTDs supplied a standard SBE-format data stream at a data
rate of 24 Hz.  These instruments provided pressure, dual temperature
(SBE3plus), dual conductivity (SBE4), dissolved oxygen (SBE43), load cell
(PMEL) and altimeter (Benthos or Simrad 807) channels.  The 36-place system
(CTD 315) also provided fluorometer (Wetlabs CDOM) and transmissometer
(Wetlabs CStar) channels.  An LADCP (RDI) was mounted on the rosette frames
and collected data independently.

Each CTD was outfitted with dual pumps. Primary temperature, conductivity
and dissolved oxygen were plumbed into one pump circuit; and secondary
temperature and conductivity into the other.  The sensors were deployed
vertically.  The primary temperature and conductivity sensors were used for
reported CTD temperatures and salinities on all casts except 30, 31 and 51
(primary pump problems) and 39 (severe bio-fouling of primary sensors).
The secondary temperature and conductivity sensors were used as calibration
checks.


1.3.  Water Sampling Package

CTD 315 rosette casts were performed with a package consisting of a
36-bottle rosette frame (PMEL), a 36-place carousel (SBE32) and 36 12-liter
Bullister bottles (PMEL).  The CTD 209 rosette package consisted of a
24-bottle rosette frame (PMEL), a 24-place carousel (SBE32) and 24 11-liter
Bullister bottles (PMEL).  Underwater electronic components are listed in
the previous section.

The CTD was mounted vertically in an SBE CTD frame attached to a plate
welded in the center of the rosette frame, under the pylon.  The SBE4
conductivity and SBE3plus temperature sensors and their respective pumps
were mounted vertically as recommended by SBE. Pump exhausts were attached
to inside corners of the CTD cage and directed downward level with the
intake ports.  The transmissometer was mounted horizontally and the
fluorometer vertically, attached to a rigid fiberglass screen that did not
impede water flow.  The altimeter was mounted on the interior side of the
screen.  The RDI LADCP was mounted vertically on one side of the 36-place
frame between the bottles and the CTD.  Its battery pack was located on the
opposite side of the frame, mounted on the bottom of the frame.

During leg 1, the LADCP was mounted on the outside of the 24-place frame.
On leg 2, the LADCP "outrigger" cage was removed and the LADCP was not
mounted on the 24-place frame during the first series of 10 casts with the
smaller frame (stations 134-143).  Beginning with station 154, the
fluorometer and LADCP were both mounted inside the 24-place frame.  The
LADCP was mounted with only the downward-facing heads installed, in order
to keep all 24 Niskin bottles on the frame.

The NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown Aft Markey winch was used for stations 1-14
(24-place rosette casts) and all 36-place rosette casts.  The Forward
Markey winch was used for 24-place rosette casts at stations 19-21, 29/1
and 30-31.  The 24-place rosette was switched back to the Aft winch for
stations 51-53 in order to troubleshoot problems with the 36-place system.
The Forward winch was used again during leg 2 for two series of casts with
the 24-place rosette, from stations 134-143 and again from station 154 to
the end of the leg.

The rosette systems were suspended from one of two UNOLS-standard three-
conductor 0.322" electro-mechanical sea cables.  Several reterminations
were made during the cruise, prior to stations 20 (Fwd), 29/2 (Aft) and 32
(Aft).

The deck watch prepared the rosette 10-20 minutes prior to each cast.  The
bottles were cocked and all valves, vents and lanyards were checked for
proper orientation.  The CTD was powered-up after arriving on station (or
10 min prior to arriving on southern stations).  The data acquisition
system in the computer lab started when directed by the deck watch leader.
The rosette was unstrapped from its tiedown location on deck.  The pinger
was activated and syringes were removed from the CTD intake ports.  The
winch operator was directed by the deck watch leader to raise the package,
the boom and rosette were extended outboard and the package quickly lowered
into the water. The package was lowered to 10 meters, by which time the
sensor pumps had turned on. After 1-2 minutes, the winch operator was then
directed to bring the package back to the surface (0 m. winch wireout) and
to begin the descent.

Each rosette cast was lowered to within 10-20 meters of the bottom, using
both the pinger and/or altimeter to determine distance.

The winch operator was directed to stop the winch at each bottle trip depth
during the up-cast.  The CTD console operator waited 30 seconds before
tripping a bottle to insure the package wake had dissipated and the bottles
were flushed, then an additional 10 seconds after bottle closure to insure
that stable CTD comparison data had been acquired.  Once a bottle had been
closed, the winch operator was directed to haul in the package to the next
bottle stop.

Three sampling plans were used in rotation to choose standard sampling
depths on each station throughout CLIVAR/Carbon P18.

Recovering the package at the end of the deployment was essentially the
reverse of launching, with the additional use of poles to grab the rosette.
The rosette was secured on deck under the block for sampling, except during
a few stations in the Southern Ocean, when the rosette was brought into the
staging bay.  The bottles and rosette were examined before samples were
taken, and anything unusual was noted on the sample log.

Each bottle on the rosette had a unique serial number. This bottle
identification was maintained independently of the bottle position on the
rosette, which was used for sample identification.  No bottles were
replaced on this cruise, but various parts of bottles were occasionally
changed or repaired.

Routine CTD maintenance included rinsing the conductivity and DO sensors
with a dilute Triton-X solution and storing it in the conductivity cells
(but not in the oxygen sensors) between casts to maintain sensor stability
and to eliminate any accumulating biofilms.  Rosette maintenance was
performed on a regular basis. O-rings were changed and lanyards repaired as
necessary. Bottle maintenance was performed each day to insure proper
closure and sealing. Valves were inspected for leaks and repaired or
replaced as needed.

The 36-place SBE32 carousel had problems releasing some lanyards, causing
mis-tripped bottles on multiple casts. This problem improved as the cruise
continued, after several repair attempts and bottle height/lanyard
adjustments.

The Forward winch readout was shorter than the maximum cast depths by
1.4-1.6%.  The largest difference was used to apply a sloped correction
(raw wireout* 1.0158) to the maximum wireout values reported for each cast
on the Forward winch.  The Aft winch readouts were nominally 0.5% larger
than maximum cast depths, with a few being negative.  No corrections were
applied to Aft winch wireout values.


1.4.  CTD Data Acquisition and Rosette Operation

The CTD data acquisition system consisted of an SBE-11plus (V2) deck unit
and a networked generic PC workstation running Windows 2000. SBE SeaSave
v.7.14c software was used for data acquisition and to close bottles on the
rosette.

CTD deployments were initiated by the console watch after the ship had
stopped on station.  The watch maintained a CTD Cast log containing a
description of each deployment, a record of every attempt to close a bottle
and any pertinent comments.

Once the deck watch had deployed the rosette, the winch operator would
lower it to 10 meters.  The CTD sensor pumps were configured with a 60
second startup delay, and were usually on by this time. The console
operator checked the CTD data for proper sensor operation, waited an
additional 60 seconds for sensors to stablize, then instructed the winch
operator to bring the package to the surface, pause for 10 seconds, and
descend to a target depth (wire-out). The profiling rate was no more than
30m/min to 50m, no more than 45m/min to 200m and no more than 60m/min
deeper than 200m depending on sea cable tension and the sea state.

The console watch monitored the progress of the deployment and quality of
the CTD data through interactive graphics and operational displays.
Additionally, the watch created a sample log for the deployment which would
be later used to record the correspondence between rosette bottles and
analytical samples taken.  The altimeter channel, CTD pressure, wire-out,
pinger and bathymetric depth were all monitored to determine the distance
of the package from the bottom, usually allowing a safe approach to within
10-20 meters.

Bottles were closed on the up cast by operating an on-screen control, and
were tripped at least 30 seconds after stopping at the trip location to
allow the rosette wake to dissipate and the bottles to flush. The winch
operator was instructed to proceed to the next bottle stop at least 10
seconds after closing bottles to insure that stable CTD data were
associated with the trip.

After the last bottle was closed, the console operator directed the deck
watch to bring the rosette on deck.  Once out of the water, the console
operator terminated the data acquisition, turned off the deck unit and
assisted with rosette sampling.


1.5.  CTD Data Processing

Shipboard CTD data processing was performed automatically at the end of
each deployment using SIO/ODF CTD processing software v.5.1.0. The raw CTD
data and bottle trips acquired by SBE SeaSave on the Windows 2000
workstation were copied onto the Linux database and web server system, then
processed to a 0.5-second time series.  CTD data at bottle trips were
extracted, and a 2-decibar down-cast pressure series created. This pressure
series was used by the web service for interactive plots, sections and CTD
data distribution; the 0.5 second time series were also available for
distribution.

CTD data were examined at the completion of each deployment for clean
corrected sensor response and any calibration shifts.  As bottle salinity
and oxygen results became available, they were used to refine shipboard
conductivity and oxygen sensor calibrations.

TS and theta-O2 comparisons were made between down and up casts as well as
between groups of adjacent deployments.  Vertical sections of measured and
derived properties from sensor data were checked for consistency.

A few CTD acquisition problems were encountered during P18.  The aft winch
had level wind problems during test cast 998.  The CTD went to depth a
second time from 540db on the upcast to correctly spool the cable onto the
winch drum.

Slower winch speeds were observed with the 24-position rosette during the
first six casts to break in the new sea cable.  Normal winch speeds resumed
with the 24-position rosette for the next nine casts.  Then the 36-position
rosette was employed.

Neither of the Benthos altimeters brought by PMEL performed well and were
retired after cast 19.  AOML's Simrad altimeter was passed between rosettes
as they were employed.

Secondary pump s/n 3481 was retired from the 24-position rosette after cast
19.  Poor data, likely owing to pump problems, were observed during casts
15 and 16 when pump s/n 3481 was used on the 36-position rosette.

Hundreds of modulo errors during cast 19 prompted retermination of the
forward winch cable used for the 24-position rosette.  The armor was not
used as the return (ground) as recommended by Sea-Bird.  Instead one of the
three conducting wires was used as ground.  The other two conducting wires
were soldered together as the positive lead.  This is the same electrical
termination scheme that had to be used on the aft winch cable prior to the
test cast to eliminate modulo errors while the rosette was still on deck.

During the recovery of the rosette after cast 28, the boom was brought in
too far and the block hit the ship, damaging the aft winch cable.  The
cable was reterminated prior to cast 29/2 after cutting off 5m of cable,
then again prior to cast 32 after cutting of 10m more of cable.

Primary pump s/n 819 was retired from the 24-position rosette after cast
51.  Bad primary data, likely owing to pump problems, were observed during
casts 30, 31 and 51.

A few modulo errors and corresponding spikes in all data channels occurred
intermittently during casts 36-50.  The errors ceased after all connections
at the CTD were reseated.

Small spikes in all data channels occurred intermittently during casts
65-75 between about 1300-1550 dbars, mostly on the downcast.  No modulo
errors.  The spikes disappeared after a new pump y-cable was installed.

Secondary conductivity sensor s/n 3068 was retired after cast 66.  Its
behavior during the cast was indicative of a cracked cell.

Several broken strands in the outer armor of the aft cable were detected
around 3400 m wire out during cast 153.  The 36-position package and the
aft cable were not used for the remainder of the cruise.

Frozen water in the pump tubes affected both primary and secondary sensors
at the start of cast 172.  Secondary sensors recovered within a few seconds
after going in, but primary conductivity did not come back fully until
about 8db on the second down (after the surface yoyo).  A later start time
was used for pressure-sequencing to bypass the questionable data.  Water
was "frozen solid" in the syringes removed prior to cast 173, but there
were no problems during the cast itself.

A total of 179 CTD casts were made (including two test casts, two TAO
calibration casts, and two casts for station 98: the first to end leg 1 and
the second to start leg 2).  The 24-place (CTD #209) rosette was used for
stations 998 (Test), 1-14, 19-21, 29/1 (TAO calibration), 30-31 and 51-53
on leg 1; and for stations 134-143 and 154-174 on leg 2.  The 36-place (CTD
#315) rosette was used for the remainder of the casts.

1.6.  CTD Sensor Laboratory Calibrations

Laboratory calibrations of the CTD pressure, temperature, conductivity and
dissolved oxygen sensors were performed prior to CLIVAR/Carbon P18.  The
calibration dates are listed in table 1.6.0 and 1.6.1.

1.7.  ODF Shipboard CTD Processing

PMEL CTD #209 or #315 was used for all P18 casts.  The CTDs were deployed
with all sensors and pumps aligned vertically, as recommended by SBE.

Primary temperature and conductivity sensors (T1 & C1) were used for all
reported CTD data except four casts: 30/1, 31/1 and 51/1 (CTD #209 primary
pump problems); and 39/1 (CTD #315 severely "slimed" by organic matter
through most of cast).  In addition, secondary data were used for CTD
bottle trip information on stations 20/1 and 21/1 (spiky/noisy salinity
caused by CTD #209 primary pump problems) and station 27/1 (due to salinity
spike/offset problems on the upcast).  The secondary sensors (T2 & C2)
usually served only as calibration checks.

Upcast data were reported shipboard for 3 casts because of sensor problems
on the downcasts: 29/2, 46/1 and 116/1.

In situ salinity and dissolved O2 check samples collected during each cast
were used to calibrate the conductivity and dissolved O2 sensors.

1.7.1.  CTD Pressure

The Paroscientific Digiquartz pressure transducers (S/Ns 209-53586 and
315-53960) were calibrated on the 9th and 27th of July 2007 at SBE.
Calibration coefficients derived from the calibrations were applied to raw
pressures during each cast.  Residual pressure offsets (the difference
between the first and last submerged pressures) were examined to check for
calibration shifts. All were < 0.4db, until stations 128-133, where the end
residual pressure offset was just below -0.5db.  The offsets were low again
until station 152, when start and end pressures out-of-water were slowly
decreasing to as much as -0.9db, presumably because of the significantly
colder water and air temperatures near the end of the cruise.  No
adjustments were made to the calculated pressures.

1.7.2.  CTD Temperature

The same four SBE3 temperature sensors were used throughout the cruise:
primary sensors (T1): S/Ns 03P-4211 (CTD #209) and 03P-4341 (CTD #315), and
secondary sensors (T2): S/Ns 03-1455 (CTD #209) and 03P-4341 (CTD #315).
All but one were SBE3plus sensors; 03-1455 was an SBE3_02/F sensor.
Calibration coefficients derived from the pre-cruise calibrations (8-13
November 2007) were applied to raw primary and secondary temperatures
during each cast.

Calibration accuracy was monitored by tabulating T1-T2 over a range of
pressures and temperatures (bottle trip locations) for each cast.  No
significant time- or pressure-dependent slope was evident during the cruise
for either pair of temperature sensors.  The T1-T2 differences for CTD #315
show good agreement during the cruise. However, there is an average +0.0008
to +0.001 deg.C T1-T2 difference for deep CTD #209 temperatures, whether or
not casts with pump problems are included.

A -0.0006 deg.C offset was applied to both temperature sensors, to account
for heating effects on the sensors from pressure (from PMEL, as recommended
by SBE).  The differences between the dual temperature sensors for each CTD
are summarized in Figures 1.7.2.0-1.7.2.1.


Figure 1.7.2.0  CTD #209 T1-T2 by station, pressure>1600db only.
Figure 1.7.2.1  CTD #315 T1-T2 by station, pressure>1600db only.


1.7.3.  CTD Conductivity

The same two conductivity sensors were used throughout the cruise on CTD
#209 (Primary/C1: S/N 04-2887, Secondary/C2: S/N 04-2882).  CTD #315 used
the same Primary sensor (C1: S/N 04-3157), but the Secondary sensor was
changed after displaying a large pressure drift during Station 66 (C2A: S/N
04-3068, C2B: S/N 04-1467).  All conductivity sensors were model SBE4C
except the replacement sensor for CTD #315, which was model SBE4.
Conductivity sensor calibration coefficients derived from the 18 October
2007 pre-cruise calibrations were applied to raw primary and secondary
conductivities.  Comparisons between the primary and secondary sensors, and
between each of the sensors to check sample conductivities (calculated from
bottle salinities), were used to monitor conductivity drifts and offsets.

There was a -0.0015 mS/cm deep offset between the CTD #209 conductivity
sensors, and an apparent pressure effect on at least one of the sensors.
The deep Bottle - C1 conductivity residual was nearly +0.006 mS/cm from the
start of the leg.

A linear pressure-dependent slope between conductivity sensors was observed
for CTD #315 from the start of the cruise; the C1-C2A difference (stations
1-65) approached -0.002 mS/cm in the deepest (near 5000db) water.  The deep
bottle - C1A conductivity offset started near +0.004 mS/cm, and rose fairly
steadily to +0.009 by the end of the leg.

Inspection of the conductivity sensor calibration reports showed that all 6
sensors brought on P18 were calibrated on the same date, with the same
calibration standard values (likely in the same bath).  Three of the first
four sensors used looked strangely similar: all showed little change since
the previous calibration, other than a "dip" of ~0.0035 mS/cm in the 28-30
mS/cm range for the previous calibrations displayed on the plot.  The
fourth sensor showed a fairly consistent offset above 40 mS/cm, then dipped
-0.003 in the 28-30 mS/cm range.  The previous calibrations were on 3
different dates; the only thing all 4 had in common was their most recent
calibration date.

The next most recent calibrations from SBE (July 2007) for the two CTD #315
conductivity sensors were found, and data were test re-averaged using those
coefficients.  Deep C1 values from early in the cruise would shift by
+0.0023 mS/cm (+0.0028 to CTDS), with insignificant changes to surface
data.  C2A values would change a similar amount, still +0.0015 higher than
C1 data.  This could explain most of the starting difference between the
CTD and bottle salinities.  These older conductivity calibration data were
NOT applied during the cruise.

The latest/Oct.2007 conductivity calibration coefficients were applied
during the cruise to all CTD data during initial processing.  PMEL
determined conductivity correction coefficients by comparing CTD data
generated by SeaSave with bottle salinities.  The same corrections were
applied to the ODF CTD data set at the end of the second leg.  ODF CTD data
reported at the end of the leg will be replaced by PMEL CTD data within a
few months after the end of the cruise.

After the CTD #315 secondary sensor died during station 66, the replacement
sensor C2B showed a very non-linear difference from C1 with respect to
pressure.  The C1-C2B deep conductivity difference was -0.007 mS/cm;
however, bottle - C2B conductivity differences started at -0.0015 and rose
to +0.0005 mS/cm during leg 1 (stations 67-98). This was much closer to
bottle values than any of the other 4 conductivity sensors, despite its
recent history of a large drift over the 19 months prior to its October
calibration.

To reduce the contamination of the comparisons by package wake, differences
between primary and secondary temperature sensors were used as a metric of
variability and used to qualify the comparisons.  The coherence of this
relationship is illustrated in Figure 1.7.3.0.  The uncorrected comparison
between the primary sensors and secondary sensors or bottle conductivities
is shown in Figures 1.7.3.1 through 1.7.3.5 (vs pressure), and Figures
1.7.3.6 through 1.7.3.10 (vs station).

The comparison of the primary and secondary conductivity sensors by cast,
after applying shipboard corrections determined by PMEL (see next section),
is summarized in Figure 1.7.3.11.

Salinity residuals after applying PMEL shipboard corrections to both sensor
pairs are summarized in Figures 1.7.3.12 through 1.7.3.14.  Secondary
conductivity sensors not used for CTD data reporting during P18 were only
nominally corrected.

Figures 1.7.3.12 through 1.7.3.14 represent estimates of the CTD salinity
accuracy at the end of P18.  The 95% confidence limits are +/-0.0012
relative to S2, and +/-0.0183 relative to all bottle salts, where
|T1-T2|<0.005 deg.C.  The 95% confidence limit is +/-0.0024 for deep bottle
salts, where pressure>1600db.  Figure 1.7.3.14 (deep bottle-CTD
differences) illustrates a small skew toward +0.001 early in leg 1, and
about -0.001 for much of leg 2.  Fine-tuning of conductivity corrections
will be considered before the final CTD data are submitted by PMEL.

Corrections were also applied to CTD data at bottle trips, used in the WHP-
and Exchange-format bottle data files produced at the end of P18 Leg 2.

1.7.4.  CTD Dissolved Oxygen

The same two SBE43 dissolved O2 (DO) sensors were used throughout this
cruise (CTD #209: S/N 43-0315, CTD #315: S/N 43-0664).  The sensors were
plumbed into the primary T1/C1 pump circuits, after C1.

The DO sensors were calibrated to dissolved O2 check samples at bottle
stops by calculating CTD dissolved O2 then minimizing the residuals using a
non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. The fitting procedure
determined the calibration coefficients for the sensor model conversion
equation, and was accomplished in stages. The time constants for the
exponential terms in the model were first determined for each sensor.
These time constants are sensor-specific but applicable to an entire
cruise.  Then casts were fit individually to check sample data via an
automated process, and the resulting deep data were checked.  Bottle data
were slightly high for stations 118 and 165, and slightly low for station
171, on deep theta-O2 overlays. These three CTD casts were adjusted for
deep consistency with adjacent casts' bottle and CTD data.  Station 38 had
multiple low/eliminated deep bottle O2 values, but was consistent on deep
theta-O2 comparisons; no adjustments were necessary.

No bottles were tripped at station 29/1 TAO calibration cast: CTDO2
corrections from station 30 were used, with a -0.01 offset term.  The
resulting data compared well with nearby casts.  There were no bottles
above 500db on station 29/2: station 28 corrections were used for this
cast.  Only a few check samples were drawn on stations 998/1 (test) and
997/1 (second TAO calibration); corrections from stations 4 and 59 were
used for 998 and 997 to fit the few bottle O2 samples and nearby casts
best.

There were numerous CTD O2 signal drops during leg 1 for CTD #209 data,
probably caused by primary pump problems (pump changed out after station
51):

Both pumps were turned off for 1 minute following signal cutouts that
caused CTD #315 to perceive out-of-water values for primary conductivity.
The CTD O2 signal was low until about 30 seconds after the pumps came back
on.

The CTD #315 O2 signal dipped when CTDS1 spiked on several casts; the
status indicated the pumps did not turn off.  Replacing the Y-cable after
station 75 fixed the problem.

The surface (0-6db) CTD O2 data were low (slow to come up at the top of the
start-cast yoyo) for station 156/1; these CTDO data were also assigned a
quality code of 3.

The dissolved O2 residuals are shown in Figures 1.7.4.0-1.7.4.2.

The standard deviations of 2.900µmol/kg for all oxygens and 0.530µmol/kg
for low-gradient oxygens are only presented as general indicators of
goodness of fit.  ODF makes no claims regarding the precision or accuracy
of CTD dissolved O2 data.

The general form of the ODF O2 conversion equation for Clark cells follows
Brown and Morrison [Brow78] and Millard [Mill82], [Owen85].  ODF models
membrane and sensor temperatures with lagged CTD temperatures and a lagged
thermal gradient.  In situ pressure and temperature are filtered to match
the sensor response. Time-constants for the pressure response Taup, two
temperature responses TauTs and TauTf, and thermal gradient response TaudT
are fitting parameters.  The thermal gradient term is derived by low-pass
filtering the difference between the fast response (Tf) and slow response
(Ts) temperatures. This term is SBE43-specific and corrects a non-linearity
introduced by analog thermal compensation in the sensor.  The Oc gradient,
dOc/dt, is approximated by low-pass filtering 1st-order Oc differences.
This gradient term attempts to correct for reduction of species other than
O2 at the sensor cathode.  The time-constant for this filter, Tauog, is a
fitting parameter.  Dissolved O2 concentration is then calculated:

     O2ml/l=[c1*Oc+c2]*fsat(S,T,P)*e(^c3*Pl+c4*Tf+c5*Ts+c6*dOc/dt)     (1.7.4.0)

where:

O2ml/l        = Dissolved O2 concentration in ml/l;
Oc            = Sensor current (uamps);
fsat(S,T,P)   = O2 saturation concentration at S,T,P (ml/l);
S             = Salinity at O2 response-time ;
T             = Temperature at O2 response-time (deg.C);
P             = Pressure at O2 response-time (decibars);
Pl            = Low-pass filtered pressure (decibars);
Tf            = Fast low-pass filtered temperature (deg.C);
Ts            = Slow low-pass filtered temperature (deg.C);
dOc/dt        = Sensor current gradient (uamps/secs);
dT            = low-pass filtered thermal gradient (Tf - Ts).


1.8.  PMEL CTD Data Processing

The reduction of profile data began with a standard suite of processing
modules (process.bat) using Sea-Bird Data Processing Win32 version 5.37e
software in the following order:

DATCNV converts raw data into engineering units and creates a .ROS bottle
file.  Both down and up casts were processed for scan, elapsed time(s),
pressure, t0, t1, c0, c1, and oxygen voltage.  Optical sensor data were
converted to voltages but not carried further through the processing
stream.  MARKSCAN was used to skip over scans acquired on deck and while
priming the system under water.  MARKSCAN values were entered at the DATCNV
menu prompt.

ALIGNCTD aligns temperature, conductivity, and oxygen measurements in time
relative to pressure to ensure that derived parameters are made using
measurements from the same parcel of water.  Primary conductivity was
automatically advanced in the V1 deck unit by 0.073 seconds.  Secondary
conductivity was advanced by 0.073 seconds in ALIGNCTD.  It was not
necessary to align temperature or oxygen.

BOTTLESUM averages burst data over an 8-second interval (+/- 4 seconds of
the confirm bit) and derives both primary and secondary salinity, primary
potential temperature (θ), primary potential density anomaly (σθ), and oxygen
(in µmol/kg).

WILDEDIT makes two passes through the data in 100 scan bins.  The first
pass flags points greater than 2 standard deviations; the second pass
removes points greater than 20 standard deviations from the mean with the
flagged points excluded.  Data were kept within 100 of the mean (i.e. all
data).

FILTER applies a low pass filter to pressure with a time constant of 0.15
seconds.  In order to produce zero phase (no time shift) the filter is
first run forward through the file and then run backwards through the file.

CELLTM uses a recursive filter to remove conductivity cell thermal mass
effects from measured conductivity.  In areas with steep temperature
gradients the thermal mass correction is on the order of 0.005 PSS-78.  In
other areas the correction is negligible.  The value used for the thermal
anomaly amplitude (α) was 0.03.  The value used for the thermal anomaly time
constant (β-1) was 7.0 s.

LOOPEDIT removes scans associated with pressure slowdowns and reversals.
If the CTD velocity is less than 0.25 m/s or the pressure is not greater
than the previous maximum scan, the scan is omitted.

BINAVG averages the data into 1-dbar bins.  Each bin is centered on an
integer pressure value, e.g. the 1-dbar bin averages scans where pressure
is between 0.5 dbar and 1.5 dbar.  There is no surface bin.  The number of
points averaged in each bin is included in the data file.

DERIVE uses 1-dbar averaged pressure, temperature, and conductivity to
compute primary and secondary salinity.

TRANS converts the binary data file to ASCII format.

Package slowdowns and reversals owing to ship roll can move mixed water in
tow to in front of the CTD sensors and create artificial density inversions
and other artifacts.  In addition to Seasoft module LOOPEDIT, MATLAB
program deloop.m computes values of density locally referenced between
every 1 dbar of pressure to compute the square of the buoyancy frequency,
N2, and linearly interpolates temperature, conductivity, and oxygen voltage
over those records where N2 is less than or equal to -1 x 10-5/s2.  Thirty-
eight profiles failed this criteria in the top 12 meters.  These data were
retained by program deloop_post.m and will be flagged as questionable in
the final WOCE formatted files.

Program calctd.m reads the delooped data files and applies final
calibrations to primary temperature and conductivity, and computes salinity
and calibrated oxygen.

Pressure Calibration

Pressure calibrations for the CTD instrument used during this cruise were
pre-cruise.  No additional adjustments were applied.

Preliminary Temperature Calibration

In addition to a viscous heating correction of -0.0006  deg.C, a linearly
interpolated temperature sensor drift correction using pre and post-cruise
calibration data for the midpoint of the cruise will be determined after
the cruise.  Viscous and drift corrections are applied to profile data
using program calctd.m, and to burst data using calclo.m.

Preliminary Conductivity Calibration

Seasoft module BOTTLESUM creates a sample file for each cast.  These files
were appended using program sbecal1.f.  Program addsal.f matched sample
salinities to CTD salinities by station/sample number.  Primary sensors s/n
3157 and 2887 were selected for all casts except 30, 31, 39, and 51.
Secondary sensor s/n 2882 was used for casts 30, 31, and 51.  Secondary
sensor s/n 3068 was used for cast 51.

For s/n 3157, program calcos3.m produced the best results for an overall
3rd-order station-dependent fit of sample data from stations 15-18, 22-29,
32-38, 40-50, 54-133, 144-153:

Conductivity calibrations were applied to profile data using program
calctd.m, and to burst data using calclo.m.

Primary sensor CTD - bottle conductivity differences plotted against
station number and pressure were used to allow a visual assessment of the
success of the fit.



2.  LOWERED ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER (LADCP)

An LDEO LADCP system was used to collect data at almost every station.
Preliminary processing was completed during the cruise using LDEO LADCP
software.


LADCP SYSTEM SETUP

Two different CTD rosettes were used on this cruise, one with 24 bottles
and one with 36 bottles. The LDEO LADCP system mounted on the 36-bottle
rosette consisted of two Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) heads
and an oil-filled rechargeable lead-acid battery pack. The installation on
deck consisted of a Macintosh computer system for data acquisition and
processing, as well as a battery charger/power supply [Thur06].

The LADCP heads and battery pack were mounted inside the 36-bottle rosette
frame and connected using a custom designed, potted cable assembly. One
head (master) was placed looking downward underneath the bottles at
approximately the same height as the CTD instruments, the other head
looking upwards (slave) above the bottle trigger mechanism. The battery
pack and LADCP were mounted on opposite sides of the rosette frame center
to avoid unequal balancing.

On the 24-place package there were two settings used on both legs of the
cruise respectively. On leg 1 two heads were mounted on an custom made
frame extension.  On leg 2 only one head was mounted looking downward,
placed underneath the bottles on an improvised mounting bracket. In both
settings the battery was placed on the opposite side to avoid horizontal
tilt due to unequal balancing.

Power supply and data transfer was handled independently from any CTD
connections.  While on deck the instrument communication was set up by
means of a network of RS-232 and USB cables, using LDEO (Columbia
University) LADCP software for instrument control, data transmission and
processing (using version IX_4) in Matlab [Thur07].


LADCP OPERATION AND DATA PROCESSING

On arrival at each station the LADCP heads were 'switched on' for data
acquisition by using the LADCP software. Then communications and power
cabling were disconnected and all connections were rinsed with fresh water
and sealed with dummy plugs. After each cast the data cable and the power
supply were rinsed, reconnected, the data acquisition terminated, the
battery charged, and the data downloaded by using the LADCP software.

Immediately after each cast a preliminary processing was executed,
combining CTD, GPS, and shipboard ADCP data with the data from the LADCPs
to produce both a shear and an inverse solution for the absolute
velocities. The preliminary processing produced velocity profiles, rosette
frame angular movements, and velocity ascii files. Plots and data files
were transferred to the ODF data processing computer on-board for access
through the website and from a shared data directory.


PROBLEMS

The system worked as planned in all three setups. Nevertheless, some
problems were encountered during the cruise.

On leg 1, the LADCP was shifted from the 24-place rosette frame at station
22.  The battery on the larger frame had not been charged for 26 hours, and
the voltage was very low. Only 10 minutes of useful data were collected
before the battery died.  The LADCP was not installed on the 24-place
rosette frame during station 29/1, the mooring calibration cast. The LADCP
was removed from the rosette frame during stations 51 und 52 while
persistent CTD signal problems were being diagnosed. At stations 86-88, one
of the four beams on the down-looking high-power ADCP head broke.  Due to
software limitations, data were not processed, and no plots were generated.
At station 89, the down-looking ADCP head was replaced by the up-looking
ADCP head, a 'regular' ADCP head. Another 'regular' head, which also had a
broken beam, was placed as up-looker. Data were collected successfully.
However, due to lack of solid particles in the low productivity area of the
water column, the ADCP could not collect enough reflections from particles.
Data quality were very poor, and no useful plots were generated. Stations
90 and 91 had the same problem as station 89.  At station 92, in order to
increase data quality, the high-power ADCP head was placed for up-looking.
However, due to a combination of hardware and software problems, the LADCP
system was not ready for data collection and did not collect any data.  At
stations 93 and 94, data were collected successfully. Data quality in deep
water was still poor; no useful plots were produced.

On leg 2, according to the chief scientists' initial decision not to mount
any LADCP on the 24-bottle rosette any more (because of concerns about
package rotation voiced by one of the shipboard technicians), no velocity
data could be collected on stations 134-143. At station 154 permission was
granted to mount one LADCP and battery pack inside the 24-bottle rosette
frame, and data were collected accordingly. Due to low insufficient battery
voltage at station 173 (bad charging cable), no data were collected on this
cast.



3.  BOTTLE SAMPLING AND DATA PROCESSING

3.1.  BOTTLE SAMPLING

At the end of each rosette deployment water samples were drawn from the
bottles in the following order:

  • Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
  • 3He
  • O2
  • ONAR
  • pCO2
  • Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)
  • pH
  • Total Alkalinity (TAlk)
  • 13C and 14C
  • Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)
  • Tritium
  • Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)
  • Nutrients
  • 32Si
  • 15N/18O
  • Salinity
  • Millero Density
  • Particulate Organic Carbon (POC)
  • CDOM2 and/or CDOM3 Characterization


The correspondence between individual sample containers and the rosette
bottle position (1-24 or 1-36) from which the sample was drawn was recorded
on the sample log for the cast.  This log also included any comments or
anomalous conditions noted about the rosette and bottles.  One member of
the sampling team was designated the sample cop, whose sole responsibility
was to maintain this log and insure that sampling progressed in the proper
drawing order.

Normal sampling practice included opening the drain valve and then the air
vent on the bottle, indicating an air leak if water escaped.  This
observation together with other diagnostic comments (e.g., "lanyard caught
in lid", "valve left open") that might later prove useful in determining
sample integrity were routinely noted on the sample log.  Drawing oxygen
samples also involved taking the sample draw temperature from the bottle.
The temperature was noted on the sample log and was sometimes useful in
determining leaking or mis-tripped bottles.

Once individual samples had been drawn and properly prepared, they were
distributed for analysis.  On-board analyses were performed on computer-
assisted (PC) analytical equipment networked to the data processing
computer for centralized data management.


3.2.  BOTTLE DATA PROCESSING

Water samples collected and properties analyzed shipboard were managed
centrally in a relational database (PostgreSQL-8.0.3) run on a Linux
system. A web service (OpenAcs-5.2.2 and AOLServer-4.0.10) front-end
provided ship-wide access to CTD and water sample data.  Web-based
facilities included on-demand arbitrary property-property plots and
vertical sections as well as data uploads and downloads.

The Sample Log (and any diagnostic comments) was entered into the database
once sampling was completed.  Quality flags associated with sampled
properties were set to indicate that the property had been sampled, and
sample container identifications were noted where applicable (e.g., oxygen
flask number).

Analytical results were provided on a regular basis by the various
analytical groups and incorporated into the database. These results
included a quality code associated with each measured value and followed
the coding scheme developed for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) Hydrographic Programme (WHP) [Joyc94].

Various consistency checks and detailed examination of the data continued
throughout the cruise.


3.3.  CHLOROFLUOROCARBON (CFC) AND SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE (SF6) MEASUREMENTS 

PIs:            John Bullister and Mark Warner

Analysts: Leg 1  David Wisegarver and Robert Letscher
          Leg 2  Nathaniel Nutter and Nick Beaird

(Prepared 2 May 2011)

A PMEL analytical system (Bullister and Wisegarver, 2008) was used for CFC-11, 
CFC-12 and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) analyses on the 2007/2008 CLIVAR P18 
expedition.  Samples for the analyses of dissolved CFC-11, CFC-12 and SF6 
('CFC/SF6') were drawn from approximately 3160 of the 5700 water samples 
collected during the expedition. Analysis of CFC-11, CFC-12, and SF6 were made 
on the same water sample. Measurements of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) were made 
on a subset of these samples, primarily in cold, deepwater samples where non-
conservative behavior of this compound is less significant. The analytical 
system was not optimized for CCl4 measurements on this cruise.  CCl4 
measurements in samples shallower than 2000 m are not reported.  CCl4 
measurements in samples collected at depths greater than 2000 m have been 
flagged as '3' (questionable).

In general, the analytical system performed well on the cruise.  SF6 
measurements were not made on a routine basis as part of WOCE or on earlier 
CLIVAR repeat hydrography cruises, and the SF6 work on CLIVAR P18 is considered 
to be a pilot study to demonstrate the feasibility of making these measurements 
more routinely on future CLIVAR cruises.  Typical dissolved SF6 concentrations 
in modern surface water are ~1-2 fmol kg-1 seawater (1 fmol= femtomole = 10-15 
moles), approximately 1000 times lower than dissolved CFC-11 and CFC-12 
concentrations.  The limits of detection for SF6 on CLIVAR P18 were 
approximately 0.02 fmol kg-1, giving a concentration range of ~ 100:1 for SF6 
measurements at present in the ocean.  SF6 measurements in seawater remain 
extremely challenging. Improvements in the analytical sensitivity to this 
compound at low concentrations are essential to make these measurements more 
routine on future CLIVAR cruises 

Water samples on CLIVAR P18 were collected in bottles designed at PMEL that use 
a modified end-cap design to minimize the contact of the water sample with the 
end-cap O-rings after closing. Two sizes of these bottles (11 or 12 liter) were 
used on the expedition. Stainless steel springs covered with a nylon powder coat 
were substituted for the internal elastic tubing provided with standard Niskin 
bottles. On the casts where water samples were collected for dissolved CFC-11, 
CFC-12 and SF6 analysis, these were the first samples drawn from the bottles. 
Care was taken to coordinate the sampling of CFC/SF6 with other samples to 
minimize the time between the initial opening of each bottle and the completion 
of sample drawing. Samples more easily impacted by gas exchange (dissolved 
oxygen, 3He, DIC and pH) were collected within several minutes of the initial 
opening of each bottle. To minimize contact with air, the CFC/SF6 samples were 
drawn directly through the stopcocks of the bottles into 250 ml precision glass 
syringes equipped with three-way plastic stopcocks. The syringes were immersed 
in a holding tank of clean surface seawater held at ~5°C until ~30 minutes 
before being analyzed.  At that time, the syringe was placed in a bath of 
surface seawater heated to ~30°C.

For atmospheric sampling, a ~75 m length of 3/8" OD Dekaron tubing was run from 
the CFC van located on the fantail to the bow of the ship. A flow of air was 
drawn through this line into the main laboratory using an Air Cadet pump. The 
air was compressed in the pump, with the downstream pressure held at ~1.5 atm. 
using a backpressure regulator. A tee allowed a flow of ~100 ml min-1 of the 
compressed air to be directed to the gas sample valves of the CFC/SF6 analytical 
systems, while the bulk flow of the air (>7 l min-1) was vented through the 
back-pressure regulator. Air samples were analyzed only when the relative wind 
direction was within 60 degrees of the bow of the ship to reduce the possibility 
of shipboard contamination.  Analysis of bow air was performed at ~25 locations 
along the cruise track. At each location, at least five air measurements were 
made to increase the precision of the measurements. The measured CFC-11 and CFC-
12 and SF6 air concentrations are reported in Table 1.

Concentrations of CFC-11, CFC-12 and SF6 in air samples, seawater, and gas 
standards were measured by shipboard electron capture gas chromatography (EC-GC) 
using techniques modified from those described by Bullister and Weiss (1988) and 
Bullister and Wisegarver (2008), as outlined below.  For seawater analyses, 
water was transferred from a glass syringe to a glass-sparging chamber (volume 
~190 ml). The dissolved gases in the seawater sample were extracted by passing a 
supply of CFC/SF6 free purge gas through the sparging chamber for a period of 6 
minutes at ~175 ml min-1. Water vapor was removed from the purge gas during 
passage through an 18 cm long, 3/8" diameter glass tube packed with the 
desiccant magnesium perchlorate. The sample gases were concentrated on a cold-
trap consisting of a 1/16" OD stainless steel tube with a 5 cm section packed 
tightly with Porapak Q (60-80 mesh) and a 22 cm section packed with Carbosieve 
G. A Neslab Cryocool CC-100 was used to cool the trap to ~70°C.  After 6 minutes 
of purging, the trap was isolated, and it was heated electrically to ~175°C. The 
sample gases held in the trap were then injected onto a precolumn (~60 cm of 
1/8" O.D. stainless steel tubing packed with 80-100 mesh Porasil B, held at 
80°C) for the initial separation of CFC-12, CFC-11, SF6  and CCl4 from later 
eluting peaks.  

After the SF6 and CFC-12 had passed from the pre-column and into the second 
precolumn (5 cm of 1/8" O.D. stainless steel tubing packed with MS5A, 95°C) and 
into the analytical column #1 (240 cm of 1/8" OD stainless steel tubing packed 
with MS5A and held at 95°C), the outflow from the first precolumn was diverted 
to the second analytical column (150 cm 1/8" OD stainless steel tubing packed 
with Carbograph 1AC, 80-100 mesh, held at 80°C). After CFC-11 had passed through 
the first pre-column, the flow was diverted to a third analytical column (1 m , 
Carbograph 1AC, 80°C). The gases remaining after CCl4 had passed through the 
first pre-column, were backflushed from the pre column and vented. Column #1 and 
the second pre-column were held in a Shimadzu GC8 gas chromatograph with an 
electron capture detector (ECD) held at 340°C. Column #2 and #3, and the first 
precolumn were in another Shimadzu GC8 gas chromatograph with ECD. The outflow 
from column #3 was plumbed to a Shimadzu Mini2 gas chromatograph with the ECD 
held at 250°C.

The analytical system was calibrated frequently using a standard gas of known 
CFC/SF6 composition. Gas sample loops of known volume were thoroughly flushed 
with standard gas and injected into the system.  The temperature and pressure 
was recorded so that the amount of gas injected could be calculated. The 
procedures used to transfer the standard gas to the trap, precolumn, main 
chromatographic column, and ECD were similar to those used for analyzing water 
samples. Four sizes of gas sample loops were used. Multiple injections of these 
loop volumes could be made to allow the system to be calibrated over a 
relatively wide range of concentrations. Air samples and system blanks 
(injections of loops of CFC/SF6 free gas) were injected and analyzed in a 
similar manner. The typical analysis time for seawater, air, standard or blank 
samples was ~11 minutes.  Concentrations of the CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air, 
seawater samples, and gas standards are reported relative to the SIO98 
calibration scale (Cunnold et al., 2000). Concentrations of SF6 in air, seawater 
samples, and gas standards are reported relative to the CMDL calibration scale 
(Bullister et al, 2006). Concentrations in air and standard gas are reported in 
units of mole fraction CFC in dry gas, and are typically in the parts per 
trillion (ppt) range. Dissolved CFC concentrations are given in units of 
picomoles per kilogram seawater (pmol kg-1) and SF6 concentrations in fmol kg-1.  
CFC/SF6 concentrations in air and seawater samples were determined by fitting 
their chromatographic peak areas to multi-point calibration curves, generated by 
injecting multiple sample loops of gas from a working standard (PMEL cylinder 
45186) into the analytical instrument. The response of the detector to the range 
of moles of CFC/SF6 passing through the detector remained relatively constant 
during the cruise. Full-range calibration curves were run at intervals of 4-5 
days during the cruise. Single injections of a fixed volume of standard gas at 
one atmosphere were run much more frequently (at intervals of ~90 minutes) to 
monitor short-term changes in detector sensitivity.

The purging efficiency was estimated by re-purging a high-concentration water 
sample and measuring this residual signal.  At a flow rate of 170 cc min-1 for 6 
minutes, the purging efficiency for all 3 gases was >99.9% and no correction for 
this has been applied to the reported water concentration values.

On this expedition, based on the analysis of ~250 pairs of duplicate samples, we 
estimate precisions (1 standard deviation) of about 1% or 0.002 pmol kg-1 
(whichever is greater) for both dissolved CFC-11 and CFC-12  measurements.  The 
estimated precision for SF6 was 2% or 0.02 fmol kg-1, (whichever is greater). 
Overall accuracy of the measurements (a function of the absolute accuracy of the 
calibration gases, volumetric calibrations of the sample gas loops and purge 
chamber, errors in fits to the calibration curves and other factors) is 
estimated to be about 2% or 0.004 pmol kg-1 for CFC11 and CFC-12 and 4% or 0.04 
fmol kg-1 for SF6). As discussed above, carbon tetrachloride was analyzed as a 
qualitative tracer only on this expedition and all reported concentration values 
(from samples deeper than 2000 m) have been flagged as '3' (questionable).

Based on the earlier occupation of the P18 section in 1994 as part of the WOCE 
program and crossings of this section by other WOCE-era sections, the region of 
the water column between 5oN and 20oS and deeper than 2000 m was thought have 
near zero levels of CFCs and SF6 at the time of the CLIVAR P18 section.  The 
means of measured values in this region on the CLIVAR P18 expedition was ~0.0025 
pmol kg-1 for CFC-11, 0.001 pmol kg-1 for CFC-12 and 0 fmol kg-1 for SF6.  Based on 
previous experiments showing a slow grow-in of CFCs in water held in the sample 
bottles, and the scatter in measured concentrations of these deep samples, we 
estimate a total sampling and analytical blank of 0.0025 pmol kg-1 for CFC-11, 
0.001 pmol kg-1 for CFC-12 and 0 fmol kg-1 for SF6. The final water concentration 
data reported here have had these blank corrections applied.

A small number of water samples had anomalously high CFC/SF6 concentrations 
relative to adjacent samples. These samples occurred sporadically during the 
cruise and were not clearly associated with other features in the water column 
(e.g., anomalous dissolved oxygen, salinity, or temperature features). This 
suggests that these samples were probably contaminated with CFCs/SF6 during the 
sampling or analysis processes. 

Measured concentrations for these anomalous samples are included in the data 
file, but are given a quality flag value of either 3 (questionable measurement) 
or 4 (bad measurement). Approximately 68 samples out of 3168 (~1.7%) CFC-11, 
CFC-12 and SF6 samples were assigned quality flags of 3 or 4.  A quality flag of 
5 was assigned to samples which were drawn from the rosette but never analyzed 
due to problems during handling or analysis (e.g., leaking, broken syringe 
etc.).

3.4.  HELIUM AND TRITIUM

Helium and Tritium samples were taken roughly every 2 degrees on even-
numbered latitudes.

Helium Sampling

Sampling alternated between taking 16 samples (depths of 0-1200m) and 8
samples (depths of 0-400m) at each station.  A duplicate was taken when 16
bottles were sampled.  A set of 4 blanks were taken at a depth of ~2500m at
five additional stations.

Helium samples were taken in stainless steel sample cylinders.  The sample
cylinders were leak-checked and backfilled with N2 prior to the cruise.
Additionally, each cylinder was flushed with N2 just prior to sampling to
help eliminate air bubbles.  Samples were drawn using tygon tubing
connected to the Niskin bottle at one end and the cylinder at the other.
Silicon tubing was used as an adapter to prevent the tygon from touching
the Niskin per the request of the CDOM group.  Cylinders are thumped with a
bat while being flushed with water from the Niskin to help remove bubbles.
After flushing roughly 1 liter of water through them, the plug valves are
closed.  As the cylinders are sealed by O-ringed plug valves, the samples
must be extracted within 24 hours to limit out-gassing.

Eight samples at a time were extracted using our At Sea Extraction line set
up in the wet-lab.  The stainless steel sample cylinders are attached to
the vacuum manifold and pumped down to less than 4e-7 Torr using a
diffusion pump for a minimum of 1 hour to check for leaks.  The sections
are then isolated from the vacuum manifold and introduced to the reservoir
cans which are heated to >90 deg.C for roughly 10 minutes.  Glass bulbs are
attached to the sections and immersed in ice water during the extraction
process.  After 10 minutes each bulb is flame sealed and packed for
shipment back to WHOI.  The extraction cans and sections are cleaned with
distilled water and isopropanol, then dried between each extraction.

332 helium samples were taken, 5 were lost due to leaks.  Helium samples
will be analyzed using a mass spectrometer at WHOI.

The helium extractions suffered from an ongoing room temperature problem in
the wet-lab.  The temperature reached 30 deg.C several times during the
cruise and leveled out at 24 deg.C the last 2 weeks.  The wet-lab proved to
be completely unsuitable for running vacuum equipment.  The cold finger had
to be repeatedly defrosted and cleaned, as it was quickly icing up due to
the excess moisture in the room.  The diffusion pump was unable to work
properly for an extended period in this kind of environment.  Midway
through the cruise, the system had to be shut down to replace and clean the
diffusion pump.  One day was lost servicing the line. This is the first
time our group has encountered this problem on a cruise.  XBT launches were
staged from the wet-lab which necessitated the outside door being propped
open for 0.5 to 1.5 hours each day.  This added to our temperature and
humidity problem.  Until the analyses are complete, it is unclear whether
these issues affected the quality of the samples.  The resulting higher
base pressure of the line reduced confidence in the ability to detect leaks
prior to the extraction process for some samples.  The fact that neither
sink in the wet-lab was fully functional also prevented using them as a
backup cooling system for the diffusion pump.  Various problems with the
ship's ice-makers also proved to be an obstacle, resulting in delayed
extraction time for some samples.


TRITIUM SAMPLING

Sampling alternated between taking 16 samples (0-1200m) and 8 samples
(0-400m) at each station.  A duplicate was taken when 16 bottles were
sampled.  A set of 3 blanks were taken at depth from five additional
stations.  Every three stations, one tritium sample was also taken from the
deepest Niskin.

Tritium samples were taken using a silicon adapter and tygon tubing to fill
1-qt glass jugs.  The jugs were baked in an oven, backfilled with argon,
and the caps were taped shut with electrical tape prior to the cruise.
While filling, the jugs are place on the deck and filled to about 2 inches
from the top of the bottle, being careful not to spill the argon.  Caps
were replaced and taped shut with electrical tape before being packed for
shipment back to WHOI.

317 tritium samples were taken.  Tritium samples will be degassed in the
lab at WHOI and stored for a minimum of 6 months before mass spectrometer
analysis.

No issues were encountered while taking tritium samples.


3.5.  OXYGEN ANALYSIS

EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES

Dissolved oxygen analyses were performed with an automated oxygen titrator
using amperometric end-point detection  [Culb87].  The titration of the
samples and the data logging and graphical display was performed on a PC
running a LabView program written by Ulises Rivero of AOML.  The titrations
were preformed in a climate-controlled lab at 18.5-22.5 deg.C. Thiosulfate
was dispensed by a 2 ml Gilmont syringe driven with a stepper motor
controlled by the titrator.  Tests in the lab were performed to confirm
that the precision and accuracy of the volume dispensed were comparable or
superior to the Dosimat 665. The whole-bottle titration technique of
Carpenter [Carp65], with modifications by Culberson et al. [Culb91], was
used.  Four replicate 10 ml iodate standards were run every 24 hours.  The
reagent blank was determined from the difference between V1 and V2, the
volumes of thiosulfate required to titrate 1-ml aliquots of the iodate
standard. The reagent blank was determined at the beginning and end of the
cruise.  This method was found during pre-cruise testing to produce a more
reproducible blank value than the value determined as the intercept of a
standard curve.  The temperature-corrected molarity of the thiosulfate
titrant was determined as given by Dickson [Dick94].


SAMPLING AND DATA PROCESSING

Dissolved oxygen samples were drawn from Niskin bottles into calibrated
125-150 ml iodine titration flasks using silicon tubing to avoid
contamination of DOC and CDOM samples. Bottles were rinsed three times and
filled from the bottom, overflowing three volumes while taking care not to
entrain any bubbles.  The draw temperature was taken using a digital
thermometer with a flexible thermistor probe that was inserted into the
flask while the sample was being drawn during the overflow period.  These
temperatures were used to calculate µmol/kg concentrations, and a
diagnostic check of Niskin bottle integrity.  1 ml of MnCl2 and 1 ml of
NaOH/NaI were added immediately after drawing the sample was concluded
using a Re-pipetor, the flasks were then stoppered and shaken well. DIW was
added to the neck of each flask to create a water seal.  24 or 36 samples
plus two duplicates were drawn from each station, depending on which
rosette was used. The total number of samples collected from the rosette
was 5598.

The flasks were stored in the lab in plastic totes at room temperature for
1.5 hours before analysis, and the data were incorporated into the cruise
database shortly after analysis.

Thiosulfate normalities were calculated from each standardization and
corrected to 20 deg.C.


VOLUMETRIC CALIBRATION

Oxygen flask volumes were determined gravimetrically with degassed
deionized water at AOML.


DUPLICATE SAMPLES

A total of 351 sets of duplicates were run.  An additional 12 samples were
collected from the uncontaminated sea water line in the Hydro Lab on NOAAS
R.H. Brown.  Two sets of triplicate samples were drawn near the end of the
CTD casts on station 18 (14 deg.25'N, 110 deg.W) and station 50 (2
deg.30'N, 110 deg.W).  One set of triplicates were drawn from the line
after it had passed through the Seabird SBE-45 Micro TSG (normal) and the
other set of triplicates after the sea water passed through the Vortex de-
bubbler and Turner flourometer.  The sampling began when the rosette was at
10 meters preparing to trip bottle 35, and ended shortly after the rosette
was at 5 meters and Niskin bottle 36 was tripped.  A similar test was
conducted a couple of weeks later to test for contamination of the
uncontaminated seawater line. The line was cleaned with bleach during the
in port at Easter Island.  A comparison of the difference between the
oxygen content of the uncontaminated seawater line and surface tripped
samples from the rosette revealed that the water from the line was now only
1.5 µmol/kg lower.

The standard deviation of replicates averaged 0.89 µmol/kg for stations
1-52.  Removing a drop on the NaOH/NaI dispenser before fixing a sample
improved the reproducibility significantly.  The standard deviation of
replicates for stations 52-89 averaged 0.14 µmol/kg. The standard deviation
of replicates for stations 99-174 averaged 0.15 µmol/kg.


PROBLEMS

Several oxygen flasks were removed and replaced with different flasks
during the cruise, after giving consistently high values.  Duplicates were
collected using each questionable flask and analyzed; if the values
differed significantly, the flask was removed.  The following flasks were
replaced:

            _________________________________________________


The titration system was replaced with the backup system after it failed on
station 79.  This system worked well for the remainder of Leg 1 and all of
Leg 2.


3.6.  ONAR SAMPLES

220 ONAR (oxygen, nitrogen, argon) samples were collected at 20 stations
for analysis ashore.  Two replicate samples were collected from each Niskin
bottle.  Surface ONAR samples (5-25m) were collected at an additional 33
stations (no duplicates).  The samples were collected in pre-evacuated
glass flasks.  The side-arm of the flask was connected to a ~75 cm length
of tygon tubing.  A length of 1/8" nylon tubing with a flow of CO2 was
inserted inside the Tygon tubing and used to flush the sidearm and area
between the 2 bottom O-ring seals.  After ~30 seconds of flushing, a second
1/8" length of tubing was connected to the Niskin bottle spigot. This tube
was flushed with seawater and inserted through the Tygon tube to the flash
sidearm as the CO2 tube was removed.  After flushing with seawater for ~30
seconds, the flask valve was opened and seawater flowed into the evacuated
flask.  Care was taken to adjust the rate of seawater flow into the flask
so the water level in the Tygon tube remained at least ~60 cm above the
sidearm.  The flasks were filled about halfway and then re-sealed.


3.7.  DISCRETE PCO2

Samples were drawn from Niskin bottles into 500 ml volumetric flasks using
Tygon(C) tubing with a Silicone adapter that fit over the petcock to avoid
contamination of CDOM samples.  Bottles were rinsed while inverted and
filled from the bottom, overflowing half a volume while taking care not to
entrain any bubbles.  About 5 ml of water was withdrawn to allow for
expansion of the water as it warms and to provide space for the stopper,
tubing, and frit of the analytical system.  Saturated mercuric chloride
solution (0.2 ml) was added as a preservative.  The sample bottles were
sealed with a screw cap containing a polyethylene liner.  The samples were
stored in coolers at room temperature generally for no more than 5 hours.

All analyses were done at 20 deg.C.  A secondary bath was used to get the
samples close to the analytical temperature prior to analysis.  As soon as
space was available in the secondary or primary bath, sample flasks were
moved into the more controlled temperature bath.  No flask was analyzed
without spending at least two hours in a bath close to the analytical
temperature.

In general, every other station was sampled with samples drawn from at
least 15 Niskin bottles with one duplicate at each station.  Near the
equator an effort was made to increase the sampling density across
stations.  South of Easter Island we increased the number of samples per
station due to the increase in ocean depth.  We also reduced the station
resolution from 2,2,2 etc. to 2,3,2,3 etc.  In total, 782 samples were
drawn from 736 Niskin bottles with 46 pairs of duplicates from Leg 1.  For
Leg 2, the respective amounts were 589, 542 and 47.  This gives a total of
1371 samples from 1278 Niskin bottles with 93 duplicates.  Most of the
duplicates agreed within 1%.

The discrete pCO2 system is patterned after the instrument described in
Chipman et al.  [Chip93] and is discussed in detail by Wanninkhof and
Thoning [Wann93] and Chen et al. [Chen95].  The major difference between
the two systems is that the Wanninkhof instrument uses a LI-COR(C) model
6262 non-dispersive infrared analyzer, while the Chipman instrument
utilizes a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector.

Once the samples reach the analytical temperature, a ~50-ml headspace is
created by displacing the water using a compressed standard gas with a CO2
mixing ratio close to the anticipated pCO2 of the water.  The headspace is
circulated in a closed loop through the infrared analyzer that measures CO2
and water vapor levels in the sample cell.  The samples are equilibrated
until the running mean of 20 consecutive 1-second readings from the
analyzer differ by less than 0.1 ppm (parts per million by volume).  This
equilibration takes about 10 minutes.  An expandable volume in the
circulation loop near the flask consisting of a small, deflated balloon
keeps the headspace of the flask at room pressure.

In order to maintain analytical accuracy, a set of six gas standards
(cylinder serial numbers CA5998 [205.07 ppm], CA5989 [378.71 ppm], CA5988
[593.64 ppm], CA5980 [792.51 ppm], CA5984 [1036.95 ppm], & CA5940 [1533.7
ppm]) is run through the analyzer before and after every ten seawater
samples.  The standards were obtained from Scott-Marin and referenced
against primary standards purchased from C.D. Keeling in 1991, which are on
the WMO-78 scale.  Prior to station 60, many values at depths from 400 to

2000 meters were higher than the highest standard (1533.7 ppm).  For this
reason, these values have been flagged as "questionable" (3) for the time
being, but after further quality control it is likely that many if not most
of these values will be flagged as "good" (2).  For most of the stations
after 155, nearly all of the samples were within the range of only two
standards: 792.51 ppm and 1036.95 ppm.

The calculation of pCO2 in water from the headspace measurement involves
several steps.  The CO2 concentrations in the headspace are determined via
a second-degree polynomial fit using the nearest three standard
concentrations.  Corrections for the water vapor concentration, the
barometric pressure, and the changes induced in the carbonate equilibrium
by the headspace-water mass transfer are made.  The corrected results are
reported at the analytical temperature and at a reference temperature of 20
deg.C.

No instrumental problems occurred during the cruise.  The relatively time-
consuming analyses and the presence of only one analyst limited the spatial
coverage.  Sampling and analyses focused on precision and accuracy rather
than high throughput.


3.8.  DIC MEASUREMENTS

The DIC analytical equipment was set up in a seagoing container modified
for use as a shipboard laboratory. The analysis was done by coulometry with
two analytical systems (PMEL-1 and PMEL-2) operated simultaneously on the
cruise. Each system consisted of a coulometer (UIC, Inc.) coupled with a
SOMMA (Single Operator Multiparameter Metabolic Analyzer) inlet system
developed by Ken Johnson [John85, John87, John93] ;  [John92] of Brookhaven
National Laboratory.

In the coulometric analysis of DIC, all carbonate species are converted to
CO2 (gas) by the acidification of the seawater sample [Dick07].  The
evolved CO2 gas is carried into the titration cell of the coulometer, where
it reacts quantitatively with ethanolamine to generate hydroxyethylcarbamic
acid.  A color indicator in the coulometer solution fades with the
absorption of CO2, thereby stimulating the hydrolytic production of a base
(hydroxide ions, OH-), which stoichiometrically titrates the
hydroxyethylcarbamic acid.  CO2 is thus measured by integrating the total
coulometric OH- production required to achieve full titration.

Each coulometer was calibrated by injecting and titrating aliquots of pure
CO2 (99.99%) by way of an 8-port valve outfitted with two calibrated sample
loops of different sizes (~1 and ~3 mL)  [Wilk93]. The instruments were
calibrated with two pairs of gas loop injections each time a new coulometer
cell was prepared.  Secondary standards were also run throughout the cruise
on each analytical system at the beginning of each cell.  These standards
are Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) consisting of poisoned, filtered,
and UV irradiated seawater supplied by Dr. A. Dickson of Scripps
Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and their accuracy is determined
shoreside manometrically (http://andrew.ucsd.edu/co2qc/).  If replicate
samples collected from the same Niskin and analyzed within the same batch
were different by more than 2 µmol/kg, additional CRMs and/or gas loops
were run in the middle or at the end of the batch.

On this cruise, the overall accuracy for the CRMs on both instruments is
shown in Table 3.8.0 and Figures 3.8.0 and 3.8.1.  Preliminary DIC data
reported to the database have not yet been corrected to the Batch 84 CRM
value (certified DIC value = 2001.23 µmol/kg), but a more careful quality
assurance to be completed shoreside will result in final data being
corrected to the secondary standard on a per-instrument basis.

Samples were drawn from the Niskin-type bottles into cleaned, precombusted
300-mL Pyrex bottles using silicone tubing. Bottles were rinsed twice and
filled from the bottom, overflowing half a volume.  Care was taken not to
entrain any bubbles.  The tube was pinched to stop flow and withdrawn,
creating a 6-mL headspace.  A small volume (0.2 mL) of 50% saturated HgCl2
solution was added as a preservative. The sample bottles were sealed with
glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease.

DIC values were reported for 2711 samples or approximately 82% of the
tripped bottles on leg 1 and 2014 or 82% of the tripped bottles on leg 2.
Full profiles were completed at every other station, with partial profiles
collected at intervening stations.  Partial profiles focused on the upper
1300 m of the water column, with fewer samples taken from deeper depths.
Two to four sets of duplicate samples were taken from all casts from
bottles collected at the surface, bottom, oxygen minimum, and 3000 m depths
on all casts (in order of preference).  Duplicate samples were interspersed
throughout the station analysis for quality assurance of the coulometer
cell solution integrity.  In total, duplicate samples were drawn from 272
bottles on leg one and 268 bottles on leg two. The average absolute value
of the difference between duplicates was 0.71 µmol/kg for both systems on
leg one and 0.73 on leg two, with values for each system shown in Table
8.0. No systematic differences between the replicates were observed.

During this cruise, SOMMA system PMEL-1 experienced problems with valve 5,
which required the replacement of tubing leading to the calibrated pipette,
as well as valve 5 itself.  The volume of the pipette will be recalibrated
and the change in total pipette volume will be corrected for in the final
data quality assurance process.


3.9.  DISCRETE PH ANALYSES

Sampling

Samples were collected in 10 cm cylindrical glass spectrophotometric cells,
cleaned and then incubated to 25.0 deg.C.

Analysis

pH (µmol/kg H2O) was measured using a Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer
according to the methods outlined by Clayton and Byrne [Clay93].  A RTE17
waterbath maintained spectrophotometric cell temperature at 25.0 deg.C.
The sulfonephthalein indicator m-cresol purple (mCP) was injected into the
spectrophotometric cells using a Gilmont microburette, and the absorbance
of light was measured at three different wavelengths (434 nm, 578 nm, 730
nm).  The ratios of absorbances at the different wavelengths were input and
used to calculate pH on the total and seawater scales, incorporating
temperature and salinity into the equations.  The equations of Dickson and
Millero [Dick87], Dickson and Riley [Dick79], and Dickson [Dick90] were
used to convert pH from total to seawater scales.  Salinity data were
obtained from the conductivity sensor on the CTD.  These data were later
corroborated by shipboard measurements.  Temperature of the samples was
measured immediately after spectrophotometric measurements using a
Guildline 9540 digital platinum resistance thermometer.


Reagents

The mCP indicator dye was a concentrated solution of 2.0 mM with an R =
1.61350.

Standardization

The precision of the data can be assessed from measurements of duplicate
samples, certified reference material (CRM) Batch 84 (Dr. Andrew Dickson,
UCSD), which calculated pH is 7.8461 on the seawater scale and at 25 deg.C,
and TRIS buffers.  CRMs and TRIS buffers were measured approximately every
half cast.

Data Processing

Addition of the indicator affects the pH of the sample, and the degree to
which pH is affected is a function of the pH difference between the
seawater and indicator.  Therefore, a correction is applied for each batch
of dye.  To obtain this correction factor, samples throughout the cruise
were measured after two consecutive additions of mCP.  From these two
measurements, a change in absorbance ratio per mL of mCP indicator is
calculated.  R was calculated using the absorbance ratio (Rm) measured
after the initial indicator addition from:

               R = Rm + (-0.00173 + 0.000382 Rm) Vind   (1)
               R = Rm + (-0.00254 + 0.000571 Rm) Vind   (2)
                   where Vind is the volume of mCP used.

Clayton and Byrne [Clay93] calibrated the mCP indicator using TRIS buffers
[Rame77] and the equations of Dickson [Dick93].  These equations are used
to calculate pHt, the total scale in units of moles per kilogram of
solution.

Approximately every other station was partially sampled.  Samples from
these "half-casts" were used for the indicator correction calculations.

3.10.  TOTAL ALKALINITY ANALYSES

Sampling

All stations were sampled with the exception of station 064 and 121 due to
the need for cell repairs and recalibration.  The sampling scheme was
roughly an alternation between full (36 Niskins) and partial (18 Niskins)
casts. When the 24 bottle roset was used all niskens were sampled. Only 3
samples were taken from stations 117-119 due to cell repairs.  All casts
had 3 duplicate samples drawn; one from the bottom Niskin, oxygen minimum,
and surface Niskin.  Samples were drawn from 10-l Niskin bottles into 500
ml borosilicate flasks using silicone tubing that fit over the petcock to
avoid contamination of DOC samples.  Bottles were rinsed a minimum of two
times and filled from the bottom, overflowing half of a volume while taking
care not to entrain any bubbles.  Approximately 15 ml of water was
withdrawn from the flask by arresting the sample flow and removing the
sampling tube, thus creating a small expansion volume and reproducible
headspace.  The sample bottles were sealed at a ground glass joint with a
glass stopper.  The samples were thermostated at 25 deg.C before analysis.

Analyzer Description

The total alkalinity of seawater (TAlk) was evaluated from the proton
balance at the alkalinity equivalence point, pHequiv = 4.5 at 25 deg.C and
zero ionic strength in one kilogram of sample.  The method utilizes a
multi-point hydrochloric acid titration of seawater according to the
definition of total alkalinity [Dick81]. The potentiometric titrations of
seawater not only give values of TAlk but also those of DIC and pH,
respectively from the volume of acid added at the first end point and the
initial emf, E0.

Two titration systems, A and B were used for TAlk analysis. Each of them
consists of a Metrohm 665 Dosimat titrator, an Orion 720A pH meter and a
custom designed plexiglass water-jacketed titration cell [Mill93]. Both the
seawater sample and acid titrant were temperature equilibrated to a
constant temperature of 25 +/- 0.1 deg.C with a water bath (Neslab, model
RTE-17).  The water-jacketed cell is similar to the cells used by Bradshaw
and Brewer [Brad88] except a larger volume (~200 ml) is employed to
increase the precision.  Each cell has a fill and drain valve which
increases the reproducibility of the volume of sample contained in the
cell. A typical titration recorded the EMF after the readings became stable
(deviation less than 0.09 mV) and then enough acid was added to change the
voltage a pre-assigned increment (13 mV).  A full titration (~25 points)
takes about 20 minutes.  The electrodes used to measure the EMF of the
sample during a titration consisted of a ROSS glass pH electrode (Orion,
model 810100) and a double junction Ag, AgCl reference electrode (Orion,
model 900200).


Reagents

A single 50-l batch of ~0.25 m HCl acid was prepared in 0.45 m NaCl by
dilution of concentrated HCl, AR Select, Mallinckrodt, to yield a total
ionic strength similar to seawater of salinity 35.0 (I ~= 0.7 M).  The acid
was standardized by a coulometric technique [Mari68] [Tayl59] and verified
with alkalinity titrations on seawater of known; alkalinity.  Furthermore,
Andrew Dickson's laboratory performed an independent determination of the
acid molality on sub-samples.  The calibrated molarity of the acid used was
0.2648 +/- 0.0001 M HCl.  The acid was stored in 500-ml glass bottles
sealed with Apiezon(R) L grease for use at sea.


Standardization

The volumes of the cells used were determined to +/-0.03 ml during the
initial steam from San Diego to the test station by multiple titrations
using seawater of known total alkalinity and CRM.  Calibrations of the
burette of the Dosimat with water at 25 deg.C indicate that the systems
deliver 3.000 ml (the approximate value for a titration of 200 ml of
seawater) to a precision of +/- 0.0004 ml, resulting in an error of +/- 0.3
µmol/kg in TAlk.  The reproducibility and precision of measurements are
checked using low nutrient surface seawater and Certified Reference
Material (Dr. Andrew Dickson, Marine Physical Laboratory, La Jolla,

California), Batch 84.  CRM's were utilized in order to account for
instrument drift and to maintain measurement precision.  Opened CRM
bottles, referred to as "old" were provided by the DIC analysts.  These
opened bottles were used to rinse the cell before using the new CRM
bottles.  Duplicate analyses provide additional quality assurance and were
taken from the same Niskin bottle.  Duplicates were either both measured on
system A, both on system B, or one each on A and B.

The assigned values of the Certified Reference Material provided by A.
Dickson of SIO is:

                 84      2201.01+/-0.41 µmol/kg   33.391


Data Processing

An integrated program controls the titration, data collection, and the
calculation of the carbonate parameters (TAlk, pH, and DIC).  The program
is patterned after those developed by Dickson [Dick81], Johansson and
Wedborg [Joha82], and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DOE94].  The program
uses a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares algorithm to calculate
the TAlk, DIC, and from the potentiometric titration data.

Problems

The electrodes on both systems became uncalibrated soon after recalibrating
the cell volume.  This caused CRM values to be different from the certified
value and so the standard deviation of CRM values is high.  We used the
ratio between our value and the certified value of total alkalinity to
correct all samples on the stations directly before and after each set of
CRM's was run.  By using this correction we did not have to routinely
recalibrate the cell volume.

For Station 50 on system B the Dosimat screw cap was not airtight and so
bubbles were allowed into the acid line which caused the data to be bad.
After this station, we replaced the acid bottle with a volumetric flask
sealed at the top with a thick layer of parafilm.  For Station 74 the pH
meter on system B did not work properly due to a loose connection inside
the instrument.  Unfortunately we did not catch this problem until after
the samples were run and the data were analyzed.  Upon opening the pH meter
we found a burnt connection and so we replaced the pH meter.

Occasionally, if the two systems were filling their cells at the same time,
the piston on instrument B would fail to register that the cell is full and
so the sample drained and would be lost.  Sporadically, a solenoid valve at
the bottom of the titration cell would fail to engage or disengage,
resulting in the loss of the sample or a failed titration due to a poor
rinse or an air bubble.

At the begining of leg 2 the volumetric flask used to hold the acid on
system B was replaced with a new dosimat bottle. Leaks in the cells on both
systems were also repaired and the cell volumes recalibrated while steaming
to the first station of leg 2. The electrodes on system B were also
replaced.

At station 116 the titrations which normally take around 20 min each
started to take much longer, some over 3 hours, due to the pH meter not
becoming stable enough (deviation less than 0.9 mV) to take a reading . It
was determined that the stirrer on system B was causing interference with
the pH meters and was replaced begining with station 120.


3.11.  C-13/C-14 Sampling Program

13C/14C surface water samples were drawn routinely from the rosette casts,
about every 1 degree of latitude.  Vertical profiles of ~18 depths were
collected at ~25 stations. Samples were collected in 500 ml glass stoppered
bottles.  First, the stopper was removed from the dry flask and placed
aside.  Using silicone tubing, the flasks were rinsed three times with the
water sample from the Niskin bottle. While keeping the tubing touching the
bottom of the flask, the flask was filled and allowed to overflow about
half its volume. Once the sample was taken, a small amount (~30 cc) of
water was removed to create a headspace and ~0.2 cc of a 50% saturated
mercuric chloride solution was added.  This was the same supply and amount
of mercuric chloride solution as used with the DIC samples. Then the neck
of the flask was carefully dried up using Kimwipes. The stopper, previously
lubricated with 4 lines of Apiezon grease, was inserted into the bottle.
The stopper was examined to insure that the grease formed a smooth and
continuous film between the flask and bottle.  A plastic clip was used to
secure the stopper to the flask and two rubber bands were wrapped over the
bottle to further secure the stopper.  The filled bottles were stored
inside the ship's laboratory to minimize temperature changes.  The samples
will be analyzed in the laboratory of Paul Quay (University of Washington,
pdquay@u.washington.edu ).


3.12.  Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)

DOC samples were collected by Stacy Brown on leg 1 and Charles Farmer on
leg 2 for analysis by Dennis Hansell of Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS).  A total of approximately 1500 dissolved
organic carbon (DOC) samples were collected from every other station during
Leg 1.  1221 samples were collected during Leg 2.  The total number of
samples collected during the entire P18 cruise is ~3720.  Data will be
available approximately seven months after sample arrival at RSMAS.

Sampling

All samples were collected directly from the Niskin bottles. Because
particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations in the surface waters can
be elevated, samples collected from the upper 250 m were filtered.  Water
was filtered through a combusted GF/F housed in an acid-washed
polycarbonate filter cartridge attached directly the Niskin bottle spigot
with silicon tubing.  Water below 250 m was not filtered because greater
than 98% or the total organic carbon is DOC.  All samples were collected
directly into an acid washed and high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles
(60 ml) flushed with Nanopure.  Samples were immediately placed upright in
a -20'C freezer and samples were shipped to shore laboratory packed in dry
ice.  All samples were kept frozen at -20 deg.C in an organic (volatile)
free environment. The first approximately 1000 samples taken freeze-thawed
one time, which will most likely not affect the integrity of the sample.


Analysis

Samples will be analyzed via the high-temperature combustion technique
using Shimadzu TOC-V systems with total nitrogen chemiluminescent
detection. Samples will be sparged of inorganic carbon by acidification
with HCl and sparging with CO2-free gas for several minutes.  A minimum of
triplicate injections of 100 µl of sample will be injected onto a Pt
alumina combustion catalyst heated to 680 deg.C. The CO2 signal will then
be detected with a non-dispersive infra-red detector.  Total nitrogen is
converted to NOx and detected via chemiluminescence.


3.13.  Chromophoric DOM

3.13.1.  Project Goals

Our goals are to determine chromophoric dissolved matter (CDOM)
distributions over a range of oceanic regimes on selected sections of the
CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography survey, and to quantify and parameterize CDOM
production and destruction processes with the goal of mathematically
constraining the cycling of CDOM. CDOM is a poorly characterized organic
matter pool that interacts with sunlight, leading to the production of
climate-relevant trace gases, attenuation of solar ultraviolet radiation in
the water column, and an impact upon ocean color that can be quantified
using satellite imagery. We believe that the global distribution of CDOM in
the open ocean is controlled by microbial production and solar bleaching in
the upper water column, and relative rates of advection and
remineralization in intermediate and deep waters. Furthermore, changes in
the optical properties of CDOM and its relationship with DOC over time
suggest the use of CDOM as an indicator of the prevalence of refractory DOC
in the deep ocean. We are testing these hypotheses by a combination of
field observation and controlled experiments. We are also interested in the
deep-sea reservoir of CDOM and its origin and connection to surface waters
and are making the first large-scale survey of the abundance of CDOM in the
deep ocean.

3.13.2.  Activities on P18

Profiling Instruments

Once each day we cast a hand-deployed free-fall Satlantic MicroPro II
multichannel UV/Visible spectroradiometer. This instrument has 11 upwelling
radiance sensors and 11 downwelling irradiance sensors in wavelength bands
ranging from 305 to 683 nm. In addition to pressure, the package measures
X-Y tilt, internal and external temperatures and also mounts a WetLabs ECO
chlorophyll fluorometer. The instrument is allowed to trail away behind the
port-side stern, then free-falls to 150 m and is hand-recovered.
Additionally a Satlantic multichannel UV/Visible spectroradiometer (SMSR)
is mounted on the ship to measure the same wavelengths channels of surface
irradiance concurrently with MicroPro casts.  We are using the radiometric
data to study the effects of CDOM on the underwater light environment, to
validate satellite ocean radiance sensor data, and to develop new
algorithms employing satellite and in situ optical sensor data to retrieve
ocean properties such as CDOM light absorbance, chlorophyll concentration,
and particulate backscattering.

The following table summarizes the 54 MicroPro casts accomplished during P18.

__________________________________________________________________________


On the core CTD we deploy a WetLabs UV fluorometer (Ex 370 nm, Em 460 nm),
which stimulates and measures fluorescence of CDOM. We are evaluating the
use of this instrument to supplement or enhance bottle CDOM measurements,
as bottle samples often do not have the depth resolution needed to resolve
the observed strong near-surface gradients in CDOM concentration, and on
cruises such as this we are not able to sample CDOM on every station.
Differences between the fluorescence and absorption profiles may reveal
gradients in chemical composition of CDOM.  The fluorometer has performed
very well: problems with temperature compensation encountered on P16N have
been corrected. Signal to noise ratios remain low for the open ocean areas
that we are studying.

This fluorometer is ganged to a WetLabs C-star 660 nm 0.25 m pathlength
beam transmissometer belonging to Dr. Wilford Gardner, TAMU. The
transmissometer is used to gauge particle load in the water column, which
can be calibrated to produce estimates of particulate carbon. Decline of
the particle load with depth can then be related to POC flux, another
element of the carbon system.

Both CDOM fluorometer and transmissometer were present on all cast taken
with the primary 36 bottle CTD package.  During the short periods during
leg 1 and 2 when the 24 bottle CTD package was used, neither sensor was
able to be attached.  After the CTD wire problems on Station 153, the CDOM
fluorometer was interfaced to the 24 bottle CTD package for the remaining
station profiles.  There was no suitable mounting location for the
transmissometer, so it was not present for the rest of the CTD profiles.


Bottle Samples

CDOM is at present quantified by its light absorption properties. We are
collecting samples of seawater for absorption spectroscopy on one deep
ocean cast each day. CDOM is typically quantified as the absorption
coefficient at a particular wavelength or wavelength range (we are using
325 nm). We determine CDOM at sea by measuring absorption spectra (280-730
nm) of 0.2µm filtrates using a liquid waveguide spectrophotometer through a
200 cm cell.  A full profile of 60 ml samples were drawn from one mid-day
CTD cast each day, into amber glass vials.  Duplicate samples were
collected at a rate of ca. 2 samples per cast.  For Leg 1 RMS differences
in absorption coefficient at 325 nm between the duplicate samples were just
over 0.012 m-1, which is ca. 9% of the average absorption coefficient at
that wavelength.  For Leg 2 RMS differences in absorption coefficient at
325 nm between the duplicate samples were 0.01 m-1, which is ca. 12% of the
average absorption coefficient at that wavelength.

Because of the connections to light availability and remote sensing, we
collect ca. 270 ml bottle samples in the top 250 m for Chlorophyll a
analysis. In addition we collect ca. 2 L surface samples from the ship's
uncontaminated seawater system for complete pigment analysis (HPLC) and
spectrophotometric particulate absorption (AP).  The sampled filters are
preserved in liquid Nitrogen and will be returned to UCSB for later
analysis.

The Chlorophyll a samples are filtered, extracted in 90% acetone, and read
on a Turner Designs 10-AU fluorometer.  Determination is made of
Chlorophyll a, the degradation product Phaeophytin a, and the sum of these
two.  Only Chlorophyll a concentrations are reported here.

We are sporadically collecting 60 ml samples for DOM characterization,
including carbohydrate and neutral sugar analysis (CDOM2C), and large
volume (ca. 2 L) samples for CDOM photolysis experiments (CDOM3C) to
compare the distribution of these quantities to that of CDOM. These
analyses and the photolysis experiment will be performed at UCSB.
Additionally every third day we collect ca. 2 L samples for POC analysis to
compare with transmissometer data.  The sampled filters are preserved in
liquid Nitrogen and will be analyzed ashore.


Leg 1 Problems

Both the MicroPro and SMSR require slowly flowing seawater for cooling.
During Leg 1 seawater was not available on the fantail for the MicroPro; it
was available on the bow for the SMSR.  To attempt to compensate for this a
stagnant fresh water cooling bath was set up for the MicroPro, with ice
carried to it about half an hour before deployment.  Various problems with
the ship's icemaker made ice unavailable for about 5 days total.  As the
table indicates, we had problems deploying the MicroPro to 150 m.  At the
beginning of the cruise we achieved casts to 150 m at 2 out of 18 stations.
On January 6 we were able to convince the Captain to have the bridge take
the ship off autopilot during the eight minutes the MicroPro was in the
water.  Casts from Jan 6th on reached 150 m or deeper at all 11 stations.
Station 46 was hindered by a strong undercurrent of ~ 1 m/s.

Early on the morning of December 29 the walk-in -20 C freezer failed, it
was fixed later that day.  Our DOM characterization samples (CDOM2C) from
station 10 were stored in there, we think they'll be fine as they were
insulated in a cooler.

Our Barnstead NANOpure water system, which we use for CDOM
spectrophotometry baselines, failed on January 1.  We used Milli-Q water
from the nutrient lab for the rest of the leg.  Comparison tests were run
on the spectrophotometer showing that Milli-Q is probably adequate.
Results showed Barnstead water contains less CDOM than Optima Spectographic
Reference Water, and Milli-Q water slightly more than Optima water.

CDOM absorption coefficient data was noisy, especially below 1500 m, on the
order of 0.08 m-1 at 325 nm. The cause remains unknown.


Leg 2 Problems

The Barnstead NANOpure water system was repaired during the turn-around at
Easter Island and provided stable CDOM baseline data for all of leg 2.  The
CDOM sample noise in the lower water column was significantly better during
leg 2 than on leg 1.  We thank all of the water sampling personnel who used
gloves and silicone tubing thereby reducing CDOM contamination of the CTD
sample bottle spigots.

A hose connected to the overboard outflow from the ship's uncontaminated
sea water system was used to provide water flow for the cooling bath for
the MicroPro.  This allowed equilibration of the instrument to sea surface
temperature prior to each optical cast.  This will improve data quality
during final processing back at UCSB.  When air temperatures neared
freezing, the cooling bath was emptied to avoid possible freezing.

When the CDOM fluorometer was moved to the 24 bottle rosette package on
Station 154, that profile was significantly different than previous
profiles.  The fluorometer had not been cleaned during the rapid switch
over from the 36 bottle rosette package.  Subsequent profiles were less
different, but there appears to be a difference in profile shape which
persisted for the remainder of the cruise.  The cause is unknown at this
point.  Comparison to discrete CDOM samples should clarify the problem.


3.14.  Nutrient Measurements

Nutrient samples were collected from the Niskin bottles in acid-washed
bottles after at least three seawater rinses, and sample analysis typically
began within 1 hour of sample collection.  Nutrients were analyzed with a
continuous flow analyzer (CFA) using the standard and analysis protocols
for the WOCE hydrographic program as set forth in the manual by L.I.
Gordon, et al. [Gord93].  5598 samples were taken at discrete depths and
analyzed for phosphate (PO4-), nitrate (NO3), nitrite (NO2) and
orthosilicic acid (H4SiO4).

Nitrite was determined by diazotizing the sample with sulfanilamide and
coupling with N-1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form an azo
dye.  The color produced is measured at 540 nm.  Samples for nitrate
analysis were passed through a cadmium column, which reduced nitrate to
nitrite and the resulting nitrite concentration (i.e. the sum of nitrate +
nitrite which is signified as N+N) was then determined as described above.
Nitrate concentrations were determined from the difference of N+N and
nitrite.

Phosphate was determined by reacting the sample with molybdic acid at a
temperature of 55 deg.C to form phosphomolybdic acid.  This complex was
subsequently reduced with hydrazine, and the absorbance of the resulting
phosphomolybdous acid was measured at 820 nm.

Silicic acid was analyzed by reacting the sample with molybdate in an
acidic solution to form molybdosilicic acid.  The molybdosilicic acid was
then reduced with SnCl2 to form molybdenum blue.  The absorbance of the
molybdenum blue was measured at 820 nm.

A mixed stock standard consisting of silicic acid, phosphate and nitrate
was prepared by dissolving high purity standard materials (KNO3, KH2PO4 and
Na2SiF6) in deionized water using a two step dilution for phosphate and
nitrate.  This standard was stored at room temperature.  A nitrite stock
standard was prepared about every 10 days by dissolving NaNO2 in distilled
water, and this standard was stored in the refrigerator.  Working standards
were freshly made at each station by diluting the stock solutions in low
nutrient seawater.  Mixed standards were verified against standards
purchased from Ocean Scientific.

A typical analytical run consisted of distilled water blanks, standard
blanks, working standards, a standard from the previous run, a deep sample
from the previous run, samples, replicates, working standards, and standard
and distilled water blanks.  Replicates were usually run for the 3 deepest
Niskin bottles from each cast, plus any samples with questionable peaks.
The standard deviation of these replicates was used to estimate the overall
precision of the method which was <1% full scale.  During the cruise, pump
tubes were changed four times, linearity was checked six times, and there
were 19 measurements of the refractive index.

Temperatures in the ship's bioanalytical laboratory fluctuated with
temperatures ranging from 17.2 deg.C to 25.3 deg.C with an average
temperature of (20.9+/-1.9 deg.C); however, temperatures were generally
stable during an individual analytical run.  On leg one, a 24-channel
Ismatec pump failed and was replace with an identical spare pump.  On leg
2, an Alpkem sampler using 35 ml polyethelene sample bottles failed and was
replaced with a Westco CS9000 sampler that used 20 ml plastic sample
bottles.

3.15.  Silica-32 Samples

Water samples were collected at six stations for analysis of 32Si ashore.
The filters originally provided (Spritzenfilter PTFE 25 mm/0.2 micron) only
produced a flow of a few drops per minute when connected by a ~50 cm length
of tubing to the Niskin bottle spigots. This was not an adequate flow rate
to allow filling  the 50 cc plastic sample vials.  As an alternate, a
sampling system used by the RSMAS DOC group was used to collect the
samples.  This consisted of a ~50 cm length of silicone tubing with a
filter holder on the end containing a 47 mm diameter GFF filter.  The
tubing was connected to the bottle spigot and a small vent near the filter
opened to allow rapid initial flushing of the upper side of the filter.
The vent was then closed and the water passing through the filter used to
rinse (3 times) and fill the sample vials.  A single GFF filter was used to
collect 2 profiles on Leg 1 and another filter was used to collect 4
profiles on leg 2.  The GFF filters were saved so they could be tested
later for possible contamination problems.

3.16.  15N and 18O Analysis of Nitrate

15N and 18O samples were collected by Stacy Brown on leg 1 and Charles
Farmer on leg 2 for analysis by Mark Altabet, School of Marine Science and
Technology, University of Massachusetts, New Bedford MA
(maltabet@umassd.edu).  A total of 1463 samples were collected from
stations during the entire P18 cruise, with 418 being collected on leg 2.
For information regarding availability of data, please contact Mark
Altabet.

Sampling

All samples were collected directly from the Niskin bottles into 125 ml low
density polyethylene (LDPE) bottles that were preloaded with dilute HCl as
a preservative.  Additionally, 300 bottles also contained an additional
reagent (sulfanilic acid) to bind expected high levels of Nitrite.
Generally the shallowest 20 depths were sampled in the upper 1200 meters of
a cast except every 10 deg of latitude where all depths were sampled.
Samples were stored at room temperature until they were returned to Mark
Altabet's laboratory.

Analysis

Samples will be analyzed by Mark Altabet. For more information regarding
the analyses, please contact Mark Altabet directly.

3.17.  Salinity Analysis

Equipment and Techniques

A single Guildline Autosal Model 8400B salinometer (S/N 61668), located in
the aft Hydro lab, was used for all salinity measurements.  A second
Guildline Autosal 8400B (S/N 68807, PMEL) was set up midway through the
cruise as a backup, and was used to run several duplicate sample boxes.
The salinometers were connected to computer interfaces for computer-aided
measurement.  Both Autosals' water bath temperatures were set to 24 deg.C,
which the Autosals are designed to automatically maintain.   The
laboratory's temperature was also set and maintained to just below 24
deg.C, to help further stabilize reading values and improve accuracy.

Salinity analyses were performed after samples had equilibrated to
laboratory temperature, usually within 12 to 24 hours after collection.
The salinometers were standardized for each group of samples analyzed
(usually 1-2 casts and up to 74 samples) using two bottles of standard
seawater:  one at the beginning and end of each set of measurements. The
salinometer outputs were logged to a computer file by the interface
software, which prompted the analyst to flush the instrument's cell and
change samples when appropriate.  For each sample, the salinometer cell was
initially  flushed at least 4 times before a set of conductivity ratio
readings were taken.

Standards

IAPSO Standard Seawater Batch P-147 was used to standardize all casts.

Sampling and Data Processing

5708 salinity measurements were taken and approximately 200 vials of
standard seawater (SSW) were used.

A duplicate sample was drawn for each cast in order to confirm sampling
accuracy.

The salinity samples were deposited into 200 ml Kimax high-alumina
borosilicate bottles, which were initially rinsed a minimum of three times
with sample water prior to filling.  The bottles were sealed with custom-
made plastic insert thimbles and Nalgene screw caps.  This assembly
provides very low container dissolution and sample evaporation.  Prior to
sample collection, inserts were inspected for proper fit and loose inserts
replaced to insure an airtight seal.  Laboratory temperature was also
monitored electronically throughout the cruise.

PSS-78 salinity [UNES81] was calculated for each sample from the measured
conductivity ratios.  The offset between the initial standard seawater
value and its reference value was applied to each sample.  Then the
difference (if any) between the initial and final vials of standard
seawater was applied to each sample as a linear function of elapsed run
time.  The corrected salinity data was then incorporated into the cruise
database.

CTD salinities on P18-2007/8 started off 0.003 low compared to P18-1994
deep data, and bottle salinities 0.003-4 high over the duration of the
cruise.  A second Autosal was set up partway through the first leg to
verify that the primary Autosal was working properly, and the replicates
agreed well.  Comparisons of I9N and P18 with historical data (both recent
cruises used the same standard seawater (SSW) batch) suggested that
corrections to the IAPSO standard seawater batch and salinity values for
P18-1994 all point to bottle salinities from this cruise being within WOCE
specs.

The latest IAPSO SSW comparison paper [Kawa06] recommends a +0.0020
correction to batch P-114 (used on P18-1997) and related salinity data,
based on using recent batches with better accuracy as the "standards".  The
P18-2007/8 SSW batch P-147 was not available at the time the paper was
written.  However, batch P-147 was also used during I8S/I9N in 2007. After
applying the Kawano et al. suggested +0.0006 correction for SSW batch P-126
to I9N-1995 data, I9N-2007 salinity data are +0.0005 to +0.001 higher than
1995 data.  Personal communication with the author [Kawa07] confirmed that
batch P-147 has been recently analyzed, and warrants a -0.0005 correction
when compared with other recent standards.

If standard batch corrections were applied to P18-2007/8 and P18-1994 data,
the residual deep salinity difference between the two P18 cruises (2007/8
minus 1994) would be ~0 to +0.001, suggesting that P18 bottle salinity data
are within WOCE specifications of +/-0.002.

Laboratory Temperature

The temperature in the salinometer laboratory varied from 22.5 to 23.5
deg.C during the cruise.  The air temperature change during any particular
run varied from -0.5 to +0.5 deg.C.  The only exception was during the
analysis of salinities for stations 168 and 169: the laboratory temperature
did deviate from the ideal range due to Brown air conditioner failure,
rising to just below 26 deg.C.

3.18.  Density Sampling

Density samples were taken approximately every 5 degrees of latitude on Leg
1 and at a higher resolution on Leg 2.  (Stations 2, 8, 17, 26, 34, 44, 55,
67, 76, 84, 110, 120, 128, 134, 140, 149, 157, 165, and 173).  Eighteen
bottles were drawn from each cast of 36 and 24 Niskins.  The samples were
drawn through a teflon tube to the neck of 125 mL HDPE bottles.  These
samples will be analyzed for density and re-analyzed for salinity back in
Miami.



4.  UNDERWAY MEASUREMENTS

The shipboard computing system (SCS) logs all data routinely acquired by
the permanent shipboard sensors including TSG, rain, meteorological
parameters, and ship speed and course.  The data are logged at 30-second
intervals and are available from the chief scientist.

Weather observations (ship position, cloud cover and type, visibility, wind
speed and direction, sea state, wave height and direction, surface water
temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wet and dry bulb air temperature)
were recorded manually at hourly intervals by the bridge and during each
hydrocast.  Copies of these data log sheets are available from the Chief
Scientist.

The following underway measurements were recorded at intervals of 30
seconds using the SCS. 'Output' is the file name of the stored data.

4.1.  UNDERWAY PCO2 SYSTEM

During the CLIVAR P18 cruise, an automated underway pCO2 system from AOML
was situated in the Hydro Lab aboard the R/V Ronald H. Brown.  This system
has been collecting data on the Brown since 1999.  The system runs on an
hourly cycle during which 3 gas standards, 3 ambient air samples, and 8
headspace gas samples from the equilibrator are analyzed (see table 4.1.0).
The standard gases used on this cruise were serial numbers CA6745 (289.06
ppm), CA5398 (370.90 ppm), and CA6352 (514.29 ppm).  They were purchased
from NOAA/ESRL in Boulder, CO and are directly traceable to the WMO scale.

     ______________________________________________________________


The system uses an equilibrator based on a design by Weiss where surface
seawater from the bow intake is equilibrated with headspace gas.  The
approximate volume of the equilibrator is 15 liters, about half of which is
filled with seawater.  The approximate flow rate through the equilibrator
is 10 - 12 liters per minute.

The equilibrator headspace is circulated through a LI-COR(R) model 6251
non-dispersive infrared analyzer (IR) and then returned to the
equilibrator.  When ambient air or standard gas is analyzed the output of
the LI-COR(R) sample cell is vented to the lab rather than the
equilibrator.  The system uses a KNF pump to draw air from the bow mast
through 100 meters of 0.95 cm OD Dekoron(R) tubing at a rate of 6 - 8
liters per minute.  A filter of glass wool at the intake prevents particles
from entering the gas stream.  Two glass condensors chilled to 1 deg.C
after the pumps remove water vapor from the headspace and air gas streams.
A column of magnesium perchlorate downstream of the condensors removes any
residual water vapor.  Fifteen seconds before the end of each measurement
phase (headspace, air, or standard gas), gas flow is stopped to allow the
sample cell of the IR analyzer to reach ambient pressure and the
measurements are taken 10 seconds after the gas flow is stopped.

A custom developed program running under LabVIEW controls the system and
graphically displays the results.  The program records the output and
temperature of the LI-COR(R), the water flow, the gas flows, the
equilibrator temperature, the barometric pressure, the GPS position and the
temperature and salinity from a Sea-Bird Micro TSG(R) located in the sink
in the Hydro Lab in addition to several other sensors.  It writes all of
this data to the output file at the end of each measurement phase.  The
details of the instrumental design can be found in Wanninkhof and Thoning
[Wann93], Ho et al. [Ho97], and Feely et al. [Feel98].

Coming out of San Diego, air values were running about 15 - 20 ppm higher
than expected.  Since the operator was also involved in collecting and
analyzing discrete pCO2 samples, minimal time was allotted to
troubleshooting the problem.  Eventually it was determined that the
solenoid valve which stops the gas flow before measurements are recorded
had failed and that standard gas flow was insufficient to flush out the
sample cell of the IR analyzer, resulting in bad calibration curves.  For
these reasons, data before January 9th are not correct.  Since gas flow of
ambient air and headspace gas was adequate for the entire cruise, it may be
possible to correct the data at a later date.



5.  DRIFTER DEPLOYMENT

A total of twelve SVP drifters and five SVP-barometer drifters provided by
the Global Drifter Program were deployed during the cruise.  Ten SVP
drifters were deployed during leg 1.  Two SVP drifters and five SVP-
barometer drifters were deployed during leg 2.  The SVP-barometer drifters
were those deployed at and south of ~50 S.  On both legs of the cruise each
drifter was removed from its plastic packaging immediately before
deployment, and on leg 2 the magnet was also removed from the drifter just
before deployment.  During leg 1, drifters were deployed after the
completion of the CTD station closest to the target deployment location,
the ship re-positioned for the transit to the next station.  Once the ship
was re-positioned and began steaming at ~1 knot, the drifter was thrown off
the fantail of the ship.  On leg 2, some drifters were deployed from the
fantail during steaming between stations to deploy them closer to the
target deployment locations.  The time and position of each drifter
deployment was recorded and transmitted via e-mail to shaun.dolk@noaa.gov.

The following seventeen drifters were deployed:

6.  ARGO FLOAT DEPLOYMENTS

Twenty-four Webb Research Corporation APEX profiling CTD floats were
launched during this cruise at the request of Argo PI Dr. Gregory C.
Johnson of NOAA/PMEL.  (Gregory.C.Johnson@noaa.gov).

Eight floats were launched during leg 1 and another sixteen during leg 2.
These floats are part of the Argo array, a global network of > 3000
profiling floats.  The floats are designed to sink to a depth of about
1000m.  They then drift freely at depth for about 10 days before sinking to
2000m, and then immediately rising to the surface, collecting CTD data as
they rise.  Conductivity, temperature, and pressure (hence salinity) are
measured and recorded at about 73 levels during each float ascent.  At the
surface, before the next dive begins, the acquired data are transmitted to
shore via satellite, and location fixes for the floats are estimated by
satellite.  The typical life time of the floats in the water is ~4 years.
Information on the floats deployed during this cruise and other PMEL floats
can be found on the PMEL Argo float web pages
(http://floats.pmel.noaa.gov/).  All Argo float data are made publicly
available on the web in real-time (http://www.usgodae.org/argo/argo.html).

All floats were checked in the ship's laboratory and started ~1-2 hours
before deployment by passing a magnet over the 'reset' area of the float.
Detailed logs of each float startup were kept and returned to PMEL.  Each
float was launched by carefully lowering it into the water using a hand-
held line.  Deployments were done after the completion of a hydrocast,
immediately after the ship had turned to the course needed to proceed to
the next station, and had begun steaming at ~1 kt.  All floats were
deployed successfully.  Following each deployment, an e-mail was sent to
pmel_floats@noaa.gov to report the float ID number, float reset time, exact
float deployment time and location, closest CTD station number, and
deployer name(s).

Argo float deployment information is summarized in the table below.

7.  XBT DEPLOYMENTS

XBTs provided by Prof. Dean Roemmich of SIO were dropped during the cruise
for purposes of evaluating fall rate errors in the equations used to
convert the time elapsed since an XBT enters the water to depth.  The goals
of this study, designed by Dr. Gregory C. Johnson of NOAA/PMEL, are to
assess possible variations in the XBT fall rate equation as a function of
ship speed and to allow comparison of co-located XBT and CTD temperature-
depth profiles.

The study design called for dropping three XBTs before and during arrival
at selected CTD stations.  The first XBT was dropped as the ship passed
over the station location at cruising speed, typically 12 or 9 kts.  After
the full XBT trace was collected, the ship turned and headed back toward
the station location.  As the ship approached the station for the second
time and slowed, with a heading adjusted to that for the CTD deployment, a
second XBT was dropped.  The third XBT was dropped as the CTD was being
deployed.  Sometimes failed XBTs or operator error resulted in deviations
from this procedure.  Most of the XBT's were Sippican "Deep Blue" models,
but the XBT's with 7 digit S/Ns starting in '02' were Sippican "T4" models,
vintage 1968.  During leg 1 only the last five digits of probe serial
numbers were recorded, and during leg 2 the last seven digits were
recorded.   Also, differences in use of the XBT acquisition program during
leg 1 and 2 appears to have resulted in different files being archived for
the drops.  The XBT drop times and dates listed below are from the XBT
acquisition computer, and generally agree to within about one minute of
those recorded in the ship's log, when XBT drop times and locations were
recorded in the log.  The drop locations and ship speeds are extracted from
ship's GPS data assuming that the computer times are correct.

The times and locations of the XBT drops are given below.  Further
information on this study can be obtained from Gregory C. Johnson
(Gregory.C.Johnson@noaa.gov).

All but the 5 deg.N 110 deg.W and 8 deg.S 110 deg.W buoy site were located
close to the P18 section and the deep CTD casts made as part of the P18
line was used as the reference stations for the buoys.  The 8 deg.S 110
deg.W required a steam of about 12 hrs each way from the P18 line.  A
separate CTD cast (997) to approximately 1000 meters depth was made about 1
mile away from the buoy site.

Details on TAO Buoy activities during P18 are available at

            entered

2007-12-15  Diggs      EXPO           Website Update    Expocode changed due to new dep. date
            According to Mary's first message, your departure time is 0215 
            15, 2007 GMT.  Based on this information new expocode for P18 2007: 
            33RO20071215.

2008-02-25  Johnson,G  CTD/BTL        Submitted         SALNTY/OXYGN
            Near the end of the 2007/2008 reoccupation of WOCE Section P18, with 
            some helpful input from Mary Johnson and Alex Orsi, Kristy McTaggart 
            and I decided to adjust some station groupings for preliminary 
            CTD/O2 conductivity calibrations using bottle salts. We finished 
            this work too late to get them integrated into the shipboard 
            preliminary data package that Mary distributed on the ship and is 
            bringing back to SIO, but not too late to send them to you before 
            leaving Punta Arenas.

            I am attaching these new preliminary CTD/O2 profiles and CTD/O2 
            values at bottle stops (all the CTD/O2 stations and a bottle file 
            with CTD/O2 and some other values in WOCE format) as a gzipped tar 
            file. I think this version of the calibration is enough of an 
            improvement over the values we gave Mary that the CTD/O2 profiles in 
            this file, along with the CTD/O2 values at bottle stops, should be 
            what are posted on the web for preliminary distribution. I hope this 
            does not cause too much inconvenience. If you have any questions, 
            please let me know. Kristy is on vacation for a few weeks, but I 
            should be back in the office this Thursday, if all goes well.

2008-02-29  Johnson,G  BTL/SUM        Submitted         use CTD/O2 values submitted 2/25/08
            The sum and sea files that Mary made during the cruise are attached. 
            You may make the data public on the website.   Again, the CTD/O2 
            values in the sea file attached should be replaced with those in the 
            sea file that I sent you a few days ago.

2008-03-12  Diggs      SUM/DOC        Data Update       ODF Sumfile and PDF Report online

            The SUMfile from ODF (M. Johnson) as well as the PDF documenation 
            file are now online.   New cruise track maps are also available 
            online, made from SUMfile.  Prelim-inary cruise tracks removed.

2008-04-08  Johnson,G  CTD            Data Update       Ctdprs, ctdtmp, ctdsal, ctdoxy 
            the values for CTDPRS, CTDTMP, CTDSAL, and CTDOXY from the attached 
            file, p18_allo.sea, should be substituted into Mary's bottle file.

2008-07-02  Johnson,M  ALKALI/CFCs    Data Update       fixed coding error, CFC redundancies
            I updated the one last TALK code for station 43-127, and re-created  
            the 3 data files for P18.  CFC redundancies resolved as analyst 
            resubmitted the data to me with only one value reported per bottle.

2008-07-17  Kappa      Cruise Report  Website Updated:  New PDF & Text docs online
            • Created text doc
            • Added Data Processing Notes to pdf and txt docs
            • Added links to tables and figures in pdf doc
            • Added CCHDO station track to pdf doc

2008-08-14  McTaggart  CTD            Submitted         Data are Final
            Attached is our short version of the final P18 .sea file with final 
            calibrations applied to CTD temperature, salinity, and oxygen.  It 
            includes only STNNBR, CASTNO, SAMPNO, BTLNBR*, CTDRAW, CTDPRS, 
            CTDTMP, CTDSAL*, CTDOXY*, THETA, SALNTY*, and QUALT1(1-4*).  
            Basically, the header followed by the first 11 columns and then an 
            abbreviated flag string.

2008-08-15  Johnson,G  CTD            Submitted         Data are Final
            This week Kristy has given Steve Diggs at CCHDO the final CTD data 
            and CTD values of pr, te, sa, & ox at bottle stops, so they should 
            merge those instead of the revised ones we provided at the end of 
            the cruise.

2009-05-15  Quay       C13/C14        Collected         Not yet analyzed
            The seawater samples that John collected on P18 for 13C and 14C 
            analyses are in my lab. Since I don't have funding for the 13C 
            (or 14C) analyses on this cruise, the sample processing has a 
            lower priority and will happen slowly. Thus, there are no 13C or 
            14C data to report at this time.
