A.2	Cruise Summary Information

WOCE Hydrographic Section P18 was completed on the NOAA Ship Discoverer in 
early 1994 by NOAA and academic researchers measuring a wide suite of 
physical, chemical, and biological processes.  The P18 section started north 
from 67°S, 103°W to 10°S, 103°W.  From there the section crossed the East 
Pacific Rise in a northwesterly direction to 5°S, 110°20'W.  The northward 
course was then resumed to 8°N, 110°20'W, where slight adjustments in 
longitude were made to bring the section to 110°W at 10°N.  From there a 
northward course was followed to the final station, in less than 200 m of 
water off the southern cape of Baja California at 22°51.2'N, 110°W.  Nominal 
station spacing was 30 nm, reduced to 20 nm from 3°S to 3°N and less from 22 
30N to the section end.  Station spacing was increased to 40 nm from 58°30' to 
48°30'S, from 10° to 5°S, and from 10° to 14°N, to make up for delays owing to 
heavy weather and winch level-wind problems.

A.2.b	Stations Occupied

A total of 185 full water column CTD/water sample stations were made along the 
section from 67°S 103°W to 23°N 110°W.  Of these, 158 stations were made using 
a 36-position, 10-liter bottle frame with a lowered Acoustic Doppler Current 
Profiler (ADCP) and a transmissometer.  The other 27 stations were made using 
a 24-position, four-liter bottle frame deployed primarily during heavy 
weather.  A Sea-Bird Electronics 911plus CTD was mounted in each frame.  In 
addition to a set of temperature and conductivity sensors resident on each 
CTD, a single set of mobile temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen 
sensors was used at every station for quality control and continuity of 
temperature and conductivity measurements while keeping each CTD mounted in 
its own frame.

Water samples were collected at every station for analyses of salt, dissolved 
oxygen and dissolved nutrients (i.e., silicate, nitrate, nitrite and 
phosphate).  Samples were drawn at selected locations for analysis of CFC-11, 
CFC-12, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity, pH, pCO2, 3He, 
tritium, dissolved organic carbon, carbon isotopes, oxygen isotopes, and other 
variables.  Daily shallow casts were made for assessment of various biological 
parameters, including productivity.  A total of 25 ALACE (Autonomous 
Lagrangian Circulation Explorer) floats were deployed during the cruise.  
Nineteen XCTDs were successfully launched between CTD/O2 stations from 1-9.5 
N. Underway measurements included ADCP data, meteorological variables, bottom 
depth, pH, pCO2, atmospheric CFCs, nitrate, and chlorophyll.

Sampling accomplished:
194 Stations were completed, including 9 on the transit to the start of the 
P18 section (Sta 1-9)

Approximately number of water samples analysed: 6147 salinity, 6042 oxygen, 
   5999 nutrients, 2960 chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 3147 Total CO2, 2998 pCO2, 
   4365 pH, 1006 DOC, 314 DON

Approximate number of water samples collected for shore-based analysis: 1002 
   helium-3, 587 tritium, 938 AMS radiocarbon (C-14) and C-13

Lowered ADCP profiles were obtained at about 158 stations using a rosette 
mounted lowered ADCP instrument.

Continuous underway ADCP measurements were made along the cruise track.

Measurents of surface-layer dissolved gases and atmospheric trace gases 
including nitrous oxide and halocarbons) were made along the transit leg (Leg 
1).  These results have been presented in the technical report: Lobert, J.M..,

A.4 	Scientific Programme and Methods

The long term objective of the Climate and Global Change Program is to provide 
reliable predictions of climate change and associated regional implications on 
time scales ranging from seasons to a century or more.  In support of NOAA's 
Climate Program, PMEL scientists have been measuring the growing burden of 
greenhouse gases in the Pacific Ocean and the overlying atmosphere since 1980.  
The NOAA Office of Global Programs (OGP) sponsored Ocean Tracers and 
Hydrography Program and Ocean-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange Study (OACES) studies 
ocean circulation, mixing processes, and the rate at which CO2 and 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are taken up and released by the oceans.  Work on 
this cruise was cooperative with the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) 
and the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS).  The research was designed 
to (1) describe water properties and relate them to circulation processes 
throughout the water column in the eastern Pacific Ocean; (2) determine the 
sources and sinks of carbon dioxide along 103-110°W; (3) study the invasion of 
CFCs in the ocean; and (4) provide a high quality set of baseline measurements 
for the continuing evaluation of changes in ocean content of dissolved gasses, 
water properties, and circulation.  This section fills a gap in the eastern 
Pacific between WOCE Hydrographic Programme (WHP) meridional sections P19 
(along 90°W) and P17 (along 135°W).  The southern end of this section 
intersects WHP S4, an E-W section along 67°S occupied in 1992.

During the transit (leg 1) from Seattle, Washington to Punta Arenas, Chile, a 
test station was occupied in the Puget Sound to evaluate the CTD/rosette 
system.  This profile was not processed and is not included in this data 
report.  In response to significant volcanic activity detected by the VENTS 
monitoring system at the East Blanco Depression (44°12'N, 129°42'W), 6 
stations were occupied in this area during leg 1.  The NOAA/PMEL VENTS program 
focuses research on determining the oceanic impacts and consequences of 
submarine hydrothermal venting.  This event was particularly interesting as 
the area is a pull-apart basin in a transform zone, possibly the site of early 
ridge formation.

Occupation of WOCE section P18 began with station 10 of leg 2, after two test 
casts were completed enroute to 67°S, 103°W from Punta Arenas, Chile. Seventy-
eight full water column hydrographic stations were occupied east of the 
Pacific Rise along 103°W from 67°S to 27°S.  Stations were spaced at 30 nm 
intervals except from 58°30'S to 48°S where spacing was increased to 40 nm 
intervals to make up time lost from bad weather and winch level wind problems.  
Features sampled during leg 2 included the Polar and Subantarctic Fronts of 
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Subtropical Front, the Subantarctic 
Mode Water, the Antarctic Intermediate Water, the Circumpolar Deep Water 
spreading to the northern reaches of the Southeast Pacific Basin, and currents 
along the Sala y Gomez Fracture Zone.

During leg 3 stations continued northward along 103°W to 10°S at 30 nm 
intervals.  The section turned northwestward from 10°S to 5°S with 40 nm 
station spacing to cross the East Pacific Rise in a perpendicular fashion.  
The 30 nm spacing was resumed from 5S to 3°S northward along 110°20'W.  From 
3°S to 3°N stations were occupied every 20 nm along the same longitude.  From 
3°N to 22 30°N stations were occupied at 30 nm intervals, except from 12°N to 
16°N, where the spacing was again increased to 40 nm to make up for time lost 
to winch level wind problems.  A gradual shift in the longitude from 110°20'W 
to 110°W was made between 8°N and 10°N.  North of 22°30'N station spacing was 
reduced to as little as 3 nm over the rapidly shoaling bathymetry approaching 
Cabo San Lucas.  The line was completed in 200 m of water at 22°51'N, 110°W.  
During leg 3, 107 full water column hydrographic stations were occupied 
sampling the deep waters of the Bauer Basin, currents associated with the 
flanks of the East Pacific Rise, tropical water masses and currents over the 
full water column, the northern mid-depth helium-3 plume, and the oxygen 
depleted layer of the tropical Eastern Pacific.

Full water column CTD/O2 profiles were collected at all stations.  Lowered 
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements were also collected on 
most casts.  In addition, underway salinity, temperature, and CO2 measurements 
were taken along the cruise track.  Shallow productivity casts were made 
daily, ALACE floats were launched at predetermined locations, and XCTDs were 
successfully dropped in a high-resolution survey from 1°N to 9.5°N.  Water 
samples were analyzed for a suite of anthropogenic and natural tracers 
including salinity, dissolved oxygen, inorganic nutrients, CFCs, pCO2, total 
CO2, pH, total alkalinity, helium, tritium, C-13, C-14, O-18, dissolved 
organic carbon, and dissolved organic nitrogen.  Samples were collected from 
productivity casts for chlorophyll and primary productivity.

Leg 1 (Seattle, Washington to Punta Arenas, Chile)

This leg was a transit leg with a test station occupied in the Puget Sound to 
evaluate the CTD/rosette system.  This profile was not processed and is not 
included in this data report.  In response to significant volcanic activity 
detected by the VENTS monitoring system at the East Blanco Depression 
(44°12'N, 129°42'W), 6 stations were occupied in this area during leg 1.

Leg 2 (Punta Arenas - Easter Island).

This leg consisted of 78 stations along 103°W; the first station on the WOCE 
Line P18 (#10) was occupied at 67°00'S 103°00'W on 26 February 1994 and the 
final station at 26°00'S 103°00'W on 23 March 1994. Except for  10 degrees of 
latitude span (58°30'S - 48°30'S), the station spacing was 30 miles.  The 
station spacing was increased to 40 miles in the above mentioned latitudinal 
band because of time lost to heavy weather and slower than normal retrieval 
rates of the CTD package due to problems with the winch level wind.  All CTD 
stations were full depth (nominally 10 m above the bottom).  Two CTD/rosette 
packages were used: a 24 position 4 l bottle rosette (21 stations) and a 36 
position 10 l bottle rosette (57 stations).  The choice between the two 
systems was usually dictated by the severity of the weather. On stations where 
the large rosette was used, a LADCP was attached to the rosette frame which 
reduced the number of bottle positions from 36 to 33.  Shallow (200 m) 
productivity bottle casts with light transmission profiles were made at 23 
stations.  Twelve ALACE floats were released at predetermined locations along 
the section and on the transit to the first station.

Leg 3 (Easter Island - San Diego).

A similar observational program was carried out on this leg (107 stations) with 
the following changes from the nominal 30-mile station spacing.  Stations were 
occupied at 40 mile intervals along a dog-leg section across the East Pacific 
Rise from 10°S 103°W to 5°S 110°20'W.  Thirty-mile spacing was resumed between 
5°S and 3°S and then reduced to 20 miles between 3°S and 3°N.  From 3°N to 
22°30'N stations were occupied at 30 mile intervals except between 12°N and 
16°N, where spacing was again relaxed to 40 miles.  Between 8°N and 10°N a 
gradual shift in longitude from 110°20'W to 110°00'W was made.  As the ship 
approached Cabo San Lucas, at the end of the section, spacing was reduced to as 
little as 3 miles over the steeply shoaling bathymetry.  Only on six stations, 
during reterminations of the CTD cable, was the 24 bottle rosette used.

Discussion:

The basic goals of the cruise were accomplished.  All casts were made to the 
bottom.  Station spacing only occasionally was increased to 40 miles from the 
nominal WOCE interval of 30 miles.  There were no significant gaps in sampling 
any of the variables.  Preliminary analysis of the Seabird CTD measurements 
and bottle data indicate that they will meet the WOCE standards.

A.5	Major Problems and Goals not Achieved

Some time was lost on the southern end of leg 2 due to weather.  We 
encountered a number of problems with the level-wind mechanism on the winch, 
which led to bad wraps on the drum.  A number of attempts were made to re-
tension the wire on the drum at sea by removing the CTD/rosette package, 
attaching a weight to the wire, and spooling the full length of the wire 
(except the last full wrap on the drum) out behind the ship while underway.  
These problems persisted throughout the cruise, and resulted in slower than 
anticipated average winch speeds and some loss of time.  Some time was lost on 
station due to conducting cable and wire termination problems.

is sent to the deck unit in RS-232 NRZ format using a 34560 Hz carrier-
modulated differential-phase-shift-keying (DPSK) telemetry link.  The deck 
unit decodes the serial data and sends it to a personal computer for display 
and storage in a disk file using Sea-Bird SEASOFT software.

The SBE 911plus system transmits data from primary and auxiliary sensors in 
the form of binary number equivalents of the frequency or voltage outputs from 
those sensors.  The calculations required to convert from raw data to 
engineering units of the parameters being measured are performed by software, 
either in real-time, or after the data has been stored in a disk file.

The SBE 911plus system is electrically and mechanically compatible with 
standard, unmodified rosette water samplers made by General Oceanics (GO), 
including the 1016 36-position sampler.  An optional modem and rosette 
interface allows the 911plus system to control the operation of the rosette 
directly, and without interrupting the data from the CTD, eliminating the need 
for a rosette deck unit.

The SBE 9plus underwater unit uses Sea-Bird's standard modular temperature 
(SBE 3) and conductivity (SBE 4) sensors which are mounted with a single clamp 
and "L" bracket to the lower end cap.  The conductivity cell entrance is co-
planar with the tip of the temperature sensor's protective steel sheath. The 
pressure sensor is mounted inside the underwater unit main housing and is 
ported to outside pressure through the oil-filled plastic capillary tube seen 
protruding from the main housing bottom end cap.  A compact, modular unit 
consisting of a centrifugal pump head and a brushless DC ball bearing motor 
contained in an aluminum underwater housing pump flushes water through sensor 
tubing at a constant rate independent of the CTD's motion.  This improves 
dynamic performance.  Motor speed and pumping rate (3000 rpm) remain nearly 
constant over the entire input voltage range of 12-18 volts DC.

The SBE 11plus deck unit is a rack-mountable interface which supplies DC power 
to the underwater unit, decodes the serial data stream, formats the data under 
microprocessor control, and passes the data to a companion computer.  It 
provides access to the modem channel and control of the rosette interface. 
Output data is in RS-232 (serial) format.

C.1.1.a. Conductivity

The flow-through conductivity sensing element is a glass tube (cell) with 
three platinum electrodes.  The resistance measured between the center 
electrode and end electrode pair is determined by the cell geometry and the 
specific conductance of the fluid within the cell, and controls the output 
frequency of a Wien Bridge circuit.  The sensor has a frequency output of 
approximately 3 to 12 kHz corresponding to conductivity from 0 to 7 S/m (0 to 
70 mmho/cm).  The SBE 4 has a typical accuracy/stability of ± 0.0003 
S/m/month; resolution of 0.00004 S/m at 24 samples per second; and 6800 meter 
anodized aluminum housing depth rating.

Pre-cruise sensor calibrations were performed at Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. in 
Bellevue, Washington.  The following coefficients were entered into SEASOFT 
using software module SEASON:

S/N 1177  September 22, 1993	S/N 1247  January 21, 1994
a =  2.28847772e¯05		a =  1.76162580e¯05
b =  5.58250114e¯01		b =  5.50791410e¯01
c = -4.14341657e+00		c = -4.07804361e+00
d = -9.59251789e¯05		d = -9.32262258e¯06
m =  4.1			m =  4.2

Conductivity calibration certificates show an equation containing the 
appropriate pressure-dependent correction term to account for the effect of 
hydrostatic loading (pressure) on the conductivity cell:

		C (S/m) = (afm + bf2 + c + dt) / [10 (1 - 9.57e¯8 p)]

where a, b, c, d, and m are the calibration coefficients above, f is the 
instrument frequency (kHz), t is the water temperature (C), and p is the water 
pressure (decibars).  SEASOFT automatically implements this equation.

C.1.1.b. Temperature

The temperature sensing element is a glass-coated thermistor bead, pressure-
protected by a stainless steel tube.  The sensor output frequency ranges from 
approximately 5 to 13 kHz corresponding to temperature from -5 to 35°C.  The 
output frequency is inversly proportional to the square root of the thermistor 
resistance which controls the output of a patented Wien Bridge circuit.  The 
thermistor resistance is exponentially related to temperature.  The SBE 3 
thermometer has a typical accuracy/stability of ± 0.004°C per year; and 
resolution of 0.0003°C at 24 samples per second. The SBE 3 thermometer has a 
fast response time of 70 milliseconds.  It's anodized aluminum housing 
provides a depth rating of 6800 meters.

Pre-cruise sensor calibrations were performed at Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. in 
Bellevue, Washington.  The following coefficients were entered into SEASOFT 
using software module SEASON:

S/N 1455  January 13, 1994	S/N 1461  February 11, 1994
a  = 3.68103063e¯03		a  = 3.68110418e¯03
b  = 6.03073078e¯04		b  = 6.00486851e¯04
c  = 1.51707342e¯05		c  = 1.48701147e¯05
d  = 2.20648879e¯06		d  = 1.99797919e¯06
f0 = 6228.23			f0 = 6212.56

Temperature (IPTS-68) is computed according to

		T (°C) = 1/{a+b[ln(f0/f)]+c[ln2(f0/f)]+d[ln3(f0/f)]}-273.15

where a, b, c, d, and f0 are the calibration coefficients above and f is the 
instrument frequency (kHz).  SEASOFT automatically implements this equation.

C.1.1.c. Pressure

The Paroscientific series 4000 Digiquartz high pressure transducer uses a quartz 
crystal resonator whose frequency of oscillation varies with pressure induced 
stress measuring changes in pressure as small as 0.01 parts per million with an 
absolute range of 0 to 10,000 psia (0 to 6885 decibars).  Also, a quartz crystal 
temperature signal is used to compensate for a wide range of temperature 
changes.  Repeatability, hysteresis, and pressure conformance are 0.005% FS.  
The nominal pressure frequency (0 to full scale) is 34 to 38 kHz.  The nominal 
temperature frequency is 172 kHz + 50 ppm/°C.

Pre-cruise sensor calibrations were performed at Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. in 
Bellevue, Washington.  The following coefficients were entered into SEASOFT 
using software module SEASON:

S/N 53960  August 4, 1993	S/N 53586  October 29, 1993
c1 = -43150.48			c1 = -39204.51
c2 =  4.54280e¯01		c2 =  6.23456e¯01
c3 =  1.34438e¯02		c3 =  1.35057e¯02
d1 =  0.037952			d1 =  0.038943
d2 =  0.0			d2 =  0.0
t1 =  30.34230			t1 =  30.46303
t2 = -1.80938e¯04		t2 = -9.018862e¯05
t3 =  4.61615e¯06		t3 =  4.52889e¯06
t4 =  2.08422e¯09		t4 =  3.30959e¯09
t5 =  0.0			t5 =  0.0

Pressure coefficients are first formulated into

		c  = c1 + c2*U + c3*U^2
		d  = d1 + d2*U
		t0 = t1 + t2*U + t3*U^2 + t4*U^3 + t5*U^4

where U is temperature in degrees Celsius.  Then pressure is computed 
according to

		P (psia) = c * [1 - (t02/t2)] * {1 - d[1 - (t02/t2)]}

where t is pressure period (microsec).  SEASOFT automatically implements this 
equation.

C.1.1.d. Oxygen

The SBE 13 dissolved oxygen sensor uses a Beckman polarographic element to 
provide in-situ measurements at depths up to 6800 meters.  This auxiliary 
sensor is also included in the path of pumped sea water.  Oxygen sensors 
determine the dissolved oxygen concentration by counting the number of oxygen 
molecules per second (flux) that diffuse through a membrane.  By knowing the 
flux of oxygen and the geometry of the diffusion path the concentration of 
oxygen can be computed.  The permeability of the membrane to oxygen is a 
function of temperature and ambient pressure.  The interface electronics 
outputs voltages proportional to membrane current (oxygen current) and 
membrane temperature (oxygen temperature).  Oxygen temperature is used for 
internal temperature compensation.  Computation of dissolved oxygen in 
engineering units is done in the software.  The range for dissolved oxygen is 
0 to 15 ml/l; accuracy is 0.1 ml/l; resolution is 0.01 ml/l.  Response times 
are 2 seconds at 25°C and 5 seconds at 0°C.

The following oxygen calibrations were entered into SEASOFT using SEACON:

	S/N 130309  September 7, 1993
	   m =  2.4544 e¯7
	   b = -4.6633 e¯10
	   k =  8.9224
	   c = -6.9788

The use of these constants in linear equations of the form I = mV + b and T = 
kV + c will yield sensor membrane current and temperature (with a maximum 
error of about 0.5°C) as a function of sensor output voltage.  These scaled 
values of oxygen current and oxygen temperature were carried through the 
SEASOFT processing stream unaltered.

C.1.2.	DATA ACQUISITION

CTD measurements were made using one of two Seabird 9plus CTDs each equipped 
with a fixed pumped temperature-conductivity (TC) sensor pair.  A mobile 
pumped TC pair with dissolved oxygen sensor was mounted on whichever CTD was 
in use so that dual TC measurements and dissolved oxygen measurements were 
always collected.  The TC pairs were monitored for calibration drift and 
shifts by examining the differences between the two pairs on each CTD and 
comparing CTD salinities with bottle salinity measurements.

PMEL's Sea-Bird 9plus CTD/O2 S/N 09P8431-0315 (sampling rate 24 Hz) was mounted 
in a 36-position frame and employed as the primary package.  Auxiliary sensors 
included a lowered ADCP, Metrox load cell, Benthos altimeter, and SeaTech 
transmissometer.  Water samples were collected using a General Oceanics 36-
bottle rosette and 10-liter Nisken bottles.  The primary package was used for 
the majority of 194 casts.

PMEL's Sea-Bird 9plus CTD/O2 S/N 329053-0209 (sampling rate 24 Hz) was mounted 
in a 24-position frame and employed as the backup package.  Auxiliary sensors 
included a Metrox load cell and Benthos altimeter.  Water samples were 
collected using a Sea-Bird 24-bottle rosette, and 4-liter Niskin bottles.  
There were 29 bad weather stations made using the smaller backup package.

The package entered the water from the stern of the ship and was held 5-20 m 
beneath the surface for one minute in order to activate the pump and attach 
tag lines for package recovery.  Under ideal conditions the package was 
lowered at a rate of 30 m/min to 50 m, 45 m/min to 200 m, and 60 m/min to 
depth.  Ship roll often caused substantial variation about these mean lowering 
rates, especially at southern ocean stations.  Load cell values were monitored 
in real-time during each cast.  The position of the package relative to the 
bottom was monitored on the ship's Precision Depth Recorder (PDR).  A bottom 
depth was estimated from bathymetric charts and the PDR ran during the bottom 
1000 m of the cast.  Fig. 2 shows the depths of bottle closures during the 
upcast.

Upon completion of the cast, sensors were flushed with deionized water and 
stored with a dilute Triton-X solution in the plumbing.  Niskin bottles were 
sampled for salinity, dissolved oxygen, inorganic nutrients, CFCs, total CO2, 
pCO2, pH, C-13, C-14, O-18, helium, tritium, total alkalinity, dissolved 
organic carbon, and dissolved organic nitrogen.  Sample protocols conformed to 
those specified by the WOCE Hydrographic Programme.

A Sea-Bird 11plus deck unit received the data signal from the CTD.  The analog 
data stream was recorded onto video cassette tape as a backup.  Digitized data 
were forwarded to a 286-AT personal computer equipped with SEASOFT acquisition 
and processing software version 4.201.  Temperature, salinity, and oxygen 
profiles were displayed in real-time.  Raw data files were transferred to a 
486 personal computer using Laplink version 3 and backed up onto 1/4" 
cartridge tapes using a Microsolutions Backpack QIC-80 external tape drive.

C.1.2.a. Data Acquisition Problems

During leg 2, station spacing increased to 40 nm between 58.5°S and 48°S owing 
to a delay in departure from Punta Arenas, delays owing to winch problems for 
some casts, and bad weather.  About 36 hours were lost waiting for the weather 
to moderate at 58S.  Other problems included poor level winding of the winch 
resulting in non-uniform lays on the drum and high tension crossing and 
snapping of the cable, compromised chemistry samples owing to contamination 
from the ship's stack output, and difficulties associated with doing CTDs from 
the stern of the ship in heavy to moderate seas at high latitudes.

Stations 8 and 9 test casts were very noisy.  Modulo errors persisted through 
cast 14.  Station 11 cast 1 did not sample the upper 800 meters and so a 
second cast was performed at this station for these bottles.  Station 11 cast 
2 CTD data was not processed.  Station 111 stopcocks and vents were left open 
therefore no samples were collected.  At station 120, upcast water sampling 
was skipped from 800 to 400 db while a fishing vessel cleared it's net out of 
the water.  Prior to station 123, the cable was reterminated after cutting off 
2500 m of cable to get below bad wraps.  At station 131 the package sat on the 
bottom for several minutes.  The upcast CTD data were bad.  Uptrace pressures 
were matched to downtrace pressures for bottle sample CTD data.  Station 160 
had increasing modulo errors during the downcast and was aborted.  Water was 
found in the ground wire at the termination.  No samples collected at station 
160.  There was no sample from station 190 bottle 11 owing to a stuck lanyard.

C.1.2.b. Salinity Analyses

Bottle salinity analyses were performed in a temperature-controlled van using 
two Guildline Model 8400A inductive autosalinometers standardized with IAPSO 
Standard Seawater batch P114.  The autosalinometer in use was standardized 
before each run and either at the end of each run or after no more than 48 
samples.  The drift between standardizations was monitored and the individual 
samples were corrected for that drift by linear interpolation.  Duplicate 
samples taken from the deepest bottle on each cast were analyzed on a 
subsequent day.  Bottle salinities were compared with preliminary CTD 
salinities to aid in identification of leaking bottles as well as to monitor 
the CTD conductivity cells' performance and drift.

The expected precision of the autosalinometer with an accomplished operator is 
0.001 pss, with an accuracy of 0.003.  To assess the precision of discrete 
salinity measurements on this cruise, a comparison was made for data from the 
instances in which two bottles were tripped within 10 dbar of each other at 
the same station below a depth of 2000 dbar.  For the 138 instances in which 
both bottles of the pair have acceptable salinity measurements, the standard 
deviation of the differences is 0.0012 pss.  This value is very close to the 
expected precision.

Calibrated CTD salinities replace missing bottle salinities in the 
hydrographic data listing and are indicated by an asterisk.

C.1.3.	POST-CRUISE CALIBRATIONS

Post-cruise sensor calibrations were done at Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. during 
May 1994.  For stations 2-8, temperature sensor T1455 (with pre-cruise 
calibration coefficients dated January 1994) and conductivity sensor C1177 
(with pre-cruise calibration coefficients dated September 1993) were selected 
as the best source of data.  Post-cruise calibrations showed T1455 had drifted 
(offset only) by approximately -0.0015; C1177 displayed a change in slope. For 
stations 9-194, sensor T1461 (with pre-cruise calibration coefficients dated 
January 1994) and C1247 (with pre-cruise calibration coefficients dated 
January 1994) were selected for final data reduction since they were used on 
both packages.  Post-cruise calibrations showed T1461 to be drifting (offset 
only) by approximately -0.006°C.  C1247 had drifted (slope and offset) by 
approximately -0.0009 S/m.

At sea monitoring and post-cruise calibration of redundant TC pair T1460/C1180 
showed T1460 had jumped by 0.002°C, warranting repair.  Redundant TC pair 
T1072/C748 post-cruise calibration showed T1072 had drifted to an offset of -
0.004°C.  These TC pairs were not included in the final processing.

C.1.3.a. Conductivity

SEASOFT module ALIGNCTD was used to align conductivity measurements in time 
relative to pressure.  Measurements can be misaligned due to the inherent time 
delay of the sensor response, the water water transit time delay in the pumped 
plumbing line, and the sensors being physically misaligned in depth.  Because 
SBE 3 temperature response is fast (0.06 seconds), it is not necessary to 
advance temperature relative to pressure.  When measurements are properly 
aligned, salinity spiking and density errors are minimized.

For a SBE 9 CTD with ducted TC sensors and a 3000 rpm pump the typical net 
advance of conductivity relative to temperature is 0.073 seconds.  The SBE 11 
deck units advanced primary conductivity 0.073 seconds but do not advance 
secondary conductivity.  Therefore when C1177 or C1247 conductivity data came 
from a secondary sensor channel the alignment was much larger, typically 0.06 
seconds versus coming from a primary sensor channel, typically 0.02 seconds.

Conductivity slope and bias, along with a pressure fudge term (beta) were 
computed by a least-squares minimization of CTD and bottle conductivity 
differences.  The function minimized was

				BC - m * CC - b - beta * CP

where BC is bottle conductivity (S/m), CC is pre-cruise calibrated CTD 
conductivity (S/m), CP is the CTD pressure (dbar), m is the conductivity 
slope, b is the bias (S/m), and beta is the pressure fudge term (S/m/dbar).  
The final CTD conductivity (S/m) is

				m * CC + b + beta * CP

The slope term m is a fourth-order polynomial function of station number to 
allow the entire cruise to be fit at once with a smoothly-varying station- 
dependent slope correction.  For each sensor a series of fits were made, each 
fit throwing out bottle values for locations having a residual between CTD and 
bottle conductivities of greater than three standard deviations.  This 
procedure was repeated with the remaining bottle values until no more bottle 
values were thrown out.

For C1177, the slope correction ranged from 1.00014254 to 1.00014262, the bias 
applied was -3.8e¯4, and the beta term was -5.69e¯9.  Of 5040 bottles, the 
percentage of bottles retained in the fit was 84.9 with a standard deviation 
of CTD versus bottle conductivity differences of 1.19e¯4 S/m.  For C1247, the 
slope correction ranged from 1.00021478 to 1.00044972, the bias applied was -
7.2e¯4, and the beta term was -1.29e¯8.  Of 5797 bottles, the percentage of 
bottles retained in the fit was 83.4 with a standard deviation of 0.87e¯4 S/m. 
The slope and bias were applied in SEACON.  The beta-fudge term was applied 
after SEASOFT post-processing in PMEL program POSTCAL.

CTD-bottle conductivity differences used for the final fits are plotted 
against cast number to show the stability of the calibrated CTD conductivities 
relative to the bottle conductivities.  The entire set of CTD-bottle 
conductivity differences are plotted against pressure to show the tight fit 
below 1000 m and the increasing scatter above 1000 m.

C.1.3.b. Temperature

In SEACON, adjustments were made to the bias of the thermistors as deviations 
from the pre-cruise calibrations on a station by station basis. These 
deviations were obtained from a linear fit of the pre-cruise and post-cruise 
temperature residuals from the pre-cruise calibration versus time.  Deep 
temperature differences between primary and secondary sensors were less than 
0.001°C.

Also, a uniform correction for heating of the thermistor owing to viscous 
effects was applied to the bias in SEACON.  This correction was obtained using 
the formula: 

				error[C] = B * sqrt(nu)*U*U

where B=0.692, U=1.02 m/s, and nu=1.7279e¯6 m2/s.  The value for viscosity nu is 
that for the peak in the distribution of the temperature and salinity bottle 
values (te=1.8°C, sa=34.67 pss).  Error[C] = 0.9464e¯3°C.  All the thermistors 
read high by this amount and were adjusted down accordingly.  The adjustment is 
near the maximum viscous heating for the encountered temperature and salinity 
range.  Thermistors will read about 0.66e¯3°C high near the surface in the 
tropics (te=30°C, sa=34.5 pss) causing an overadjustment of 0.29e¯3°C.  For deep 
values (te=0°C, sa=37 pss) where gradients are small, thermistors will read 
about 0.97e¯3°C high and so will be underadjusted by 0.2e¯3°C.

C.1.3.c. Oxygen

In situ oxygen samples collected during CTD profiles are used for post-
measurement calibration.  SEASOFT bottle files were merged and bottle oxygen 
values flagged as 'good' were appended to the data records.  Because the 
dissolved oxygen sensor has an obvious hysteresis, PMEL program OXDWNP 
replaced up-profile water sample data with corresponding down-profile CTD/O2 
data at common pressure levels.  Oxygen saturation values were computed 
according to Benson and Krause (1984) in units of µmol/kg.

The algorithm used for converting oxygen sensor current and probe temperature 
measurements to oxygen as described by Owens and Millard (1985) requires a 
non-linear least squares regression technique in order to determine the best 
fit coefficients of the model for oxygen sensor behavior to the water sample 
observations.  WHOI program OXFITMR uses Numerical REcipes (Press et al., 
1986) Fortran routines MRQMIN, MRQCOF, GAUSSJ, and COVSRT to perform non-
linear least squares regression using Levenberg-Marquardt method.  A Fortran 
subroutine FOXY describes the oxygen model with the derivatives of the model 
with respect to six coefficients in the following order: oxygen current slope, 
temperature correction, pressure correction, weight, oxygen current bias, and 
oxygen current lag.

Program OXFITMR reads the data for a group of stations.  The time rate of 
change of oxygen current is computed using a least squares estimate over 15 
second intervals.  The data are editted to remove spurious points where values 
are less than zero or greater than 1.2 times the saturation value.  The 
routine varies the six (or fewer) parameters of the model in such a way as to 
produce the minimum sum of squares in the difference between the calibration 
oxygens and the computed values.  Individual differences between the 
calibration oxygens and the computed oxygen values (residuals) are then 
compared with the standard deviation of the residuals.  Any residual exceeding 
an edit factor of 2.8 standard deviations is rejected.  A factor of 2.8 will 
have a 0.5% chance of rejecting a valid oxygen value for a normally 
distributed set of residuals. The iterative fitting process is continued until 
none of the data fail the edit criteria.  The best fit to the oxygen probe 
model coefficients is then determined.  Coefficents were applied by PMEL 
program CALOX2W and CTD oxygen was computed using subroutine OXY6W.

By plotting the oxygen residuals versus station, appropriate station groupings 
for further refinements of fitting were obtained by looking for abrupt station 
to station changes in the residuals.  Sometimes it was necessary to fix values 
of some oxygen algorithm parameters to keep those parameters within a 
reasonable range.  Final coefficients were applied by PMEL program EPSBE94.

C.1.4.	POST-CRUISE PROCESSING

SEASOFT consists of modular menu driven routines for acquisition, display, 
processing, and archiving of oceanographic data acquired with Sea-Bird 
equipment and is designed to work with an IBM or compatible personal computer.  
Raw data is acquired from the instruments and is stored as unmodified data.  
The conversion module DATCNV uses the instrument configuration and calibration 
coefficients to create a converted engineering unit data file that is operated 
on by all SEASOFT post processing modules.  Each SEASOFT module that modifies 
the converted data file adds information to the header of the converted file 
permitting tracking of how the various oceanographic parameters were obtained. 
The converted data is stored in either rows and columns of ascii numbers or as 
a binary data stream with each value stored as a 4 byte binary floating point 
number.  The last data column is a flag field used to mark scans as good or 
bad.

The following are the SEASOFT processing module sequence and specifications 
used in the reduction of P18 CTD/O2 data.

DATCNV converted the raw data to pressure, temperature, conductivity, oxygen 
current, oxygen temperature, and transmissometer voltage.  DATCNV also 
extracted bottle information where scans were marked with the bottle confirm 
bit during acquisition.

ROSSUM created a summary of the bottle data.  Bottle position, date, and time 
were output as the first two columns.  Pressure, temperature, conductivity, 
oxygen current, oxygen temperature, and transmissometer voltage were averaged 
over a two-second interval (48 scans).  For the primary package, the time 
interval was from five to three seconds prior to the confirm bit in order to 
avoid spikes in conductivity and oxygen current owing to minor 
incompatibilities between the Sea-Bird 911plus CTD system and General Oceanics 
1016 rosette. Bottle data from the backup package were averaged from one second 
prior to the confirm bit to 1 second after the confirm bit in the data stream.

WILDEDIT marked extreme outliers in the data files.  The first pass of 
WILDEDIT obtained an accurate estimate of the true standard deviation of the 
data.  The data were read in blocks of 200 scans.  Data greater than two 
standard deviations were flagged.  The second pass computed a standard 
deviation over the same 200 scans excluding the flagged values.  Values 
greater than 16 standard deviations were marked bad.

SPLIT removed decreasing pressure records from the data files leaving only the 
downcast.

FILTER performed a low pass filter on pressure with a time constant of 0.15 
seconds.  In order to produce zero phase (no time shift) the filter first runs 
forward through the file and then runs backwards through the file.

ALIGNCTD aligned conductivity in time relative to pressure to ensure that all 
calculations were made using measurements from the same parcel of water.  
Alignment between stations was checked every time the CTD configuration 
changed between primary and secondary underwater packages or every ten 
stations, whichever was less.

CELLTM used a recursive filter to remove conductivity cell thermal mass 
effects from the measured conductivity.  Typical values were used for thermal 
anomaly amplitude (alpha=0.03) and the time constant (1/beta=9.0).

DERIVE was used to compute fall rate (m/s) with a time window size for fall 
rate and acceleration of 2.0 seconds.

LOOPEDIT marked scans where the CTD was moving less than the minimum velocity 
of 0.2 m/s or travelling backwards due to ship roll.

BINAVG averaged the data into 1 db pressure bins starting at 1 db with no 
surface bin.  The center value of the first bin was set equal to the bin size.  
The bin minimum and maximum values are the center value ± half the bin size.  
Scans with pressures greater than the minimum and less than or equal to the 
maximum were averaged.  Scans were interpolated so that a data record exists 
every decibar.

STRIP removed scan number and fall rate from the data files.

TRANS converted the data file format from binary to ascii.

Following the SEASOFT processing modules, PMEL program POSTCAL corrected 
conductivity with respect to pressure using an additional beta term,

	beta  = -1.29e¯8  for C1247
	beta  = -5.69e¯8  for C1177
	c2(i) = (c1(i)*10) + beta * p(i)

computed salinity,
			s(i) = SAL78(c2(i)/42.914,t1(i),p(i),0)

corrected temperature due to instrument calibration error,

		t2(i) = 1.00008961734348 * t1(i) - 9.924374518041036e¯4

and backed out final conductivity values.

	c3(i) = SAL78(s(i),t2(i),p(i),1)
	c3(i) = c3(i) * 42.914

Also, POSTCAL interpolated temperature, conductivity, oxygen current, oxygen 
temperature, and transmissometer voltage where values were bad as flagged by 
SEASOFT before the above corrections and repeated to the surface the first 
good record input interactively by the user.

PMEL program EPSBE94 followed POSTCAL and computed doxc/dt, calibrated CTD 
oxygens, and computed ITS-90 temperature, potential temperature, sigma-t, 
sigma-theta, and dynamic height.  EPSBE94 also introduced the WOCE quality 
flag associated with pressure, temperature, salinity, and CTD oxygen.  Quality 
flag definitions can be found in the WOCE Operations Manual (1994).  1 db data 
were output in EPIC format (Soreide, 1995).  Processed data were despiked and 
values linearly interpolated.  WOCE flags were ammended to reflect these 
changes.

F.	WHPO Summary

Several data files are associated with this report.  They are the 
31DSCG94_2.sum and 31DSCG94_3.sum, 31DSCG94_2.hyd and 31DSCG94_3.hyd, 
31DSCG94_2.csl and 31DSCG94_3.csl and *.wct files.  The *.sum file contains a 
summary of the location, time, type of parameters sampled, and other pertinent 
information regarding each hydrographic station.  The *.hyd file contains the 
bottle data. The *.wct files are the ctd data for each station.  When 
submitted to the SAC, the *.wct files are zipped into one file called 
*wct.zip. The *.csl file is a listing of ctd and calculated values at standard 
levels.

The following is a description of how the standard levels and calculated 
values were derived for the *.csl file:

Salinity, Temperature and Pressure: These three values were smoothed from the 
individual CTD files over the N uniformly increasing pressure levels.

using the following binomial filter-

		t(j) = 0.25ti(j¯1) + 0.5ti(j) + 0.25ti(j+1) j=2....N¯1

When a pressure level is represented in the *.csl file that is not contained 
within the ctd values, the value was linearly interpolated to the desired 
level after applying the binomial filtering.

Sigma-theta(SIG-TH:KG/M3), Sigma-2 (SIG-2: KG/M3), and Sigma-4(SIG-4: KG/M3): 
These values are calculated using the practical salinity scale (PSS-78) and 
the international equation of state for seawater (EOS-80) as described in the 
Unesco publication 44 at reference pressures of the surface for SIG-TH; 2000 
dbars for Sigma-2; and 4000 dbars for Sigma-4.

Gradient Potential Temperature (GRD-PT: C/DB 10-3) is calculated as the least 
squares slope between two levels, where the standard level is the center of 
the interval.  The interval being the smallest of the two differences between 
the standard level and the two closest values. The slope is first determined 
using CTD temperature and then the adiabatic lapse rate is subtracted to 
obtain the gradient potential temperature.  Equations and Fortran routines are 
described in Unesco publication 44.

Gradient Salinity (GRD-S: 1/DB 10-3) is calculated as the least squares slope 
between two levels, where the standard level is the center of the standard 
level and the two closes values.  Equations and Fortran routines are described 
in Unesco publication 44.

Potential Vorticity (POT-V: 1/ms 10-11) is calculated as the vertical 
component ignoring contributions due to relative vorticity, i.e. pv=fN2/g, 
where f is the coriolius parameter, N is the buoyancy frequency (data 
expressed as radius/sec), and g is the local acceleration of gravity.

Buoyancy Frequency (B-V: cph) is calculated using the adiabatic leveling 
method, Fofonoff (1985) and Millard, Owens and Fofonoff (1990).  Equations and 
Fortran routines are described in Unesco publication 44.

Potential Energy (PE: J/M2: 10-5) and Dynamic Height (DYN-HT: M) are 
calculated by integrating from 0 to the level of interest.  Equations and 
Fortran routines are described in Unesco publication 44.

Neutral Density (GAMMA-N: KG/M3) is calculated with the program GAMMA-N 
(Jackett and McDougall) version 1.3 Nov. 94.

1.0	GENERAL INFORMATION

WOCE cruise P18 was s carried out aboard the R/V Discoverer in the southeastern 
Pacific Ocean. The WHPO designation for this cruise was 31DSCG94/2,3. Bruce Taft 
and John Bullister, were the chief scientists for leg 2 and Gregory Johnson and 
Richard Feely for leg 3 (all from NOAA-PMEL). Leg 2 (P18S) departed Punta Arenas, 
Chile on February 22, 1994 and ended on March 2, 1994 at Easter Island. The next 
leg, P18N, departed Easter Island March 27, 1994 and ended at San Diego, CA on 
April 3, 1994. Together the two legs made a meridional section approximately along 
106°W from approximately 67°S to 24°N. The reader is referred to cruise 
documentation provided by the chief scientists as the primary source for cruise 
information. This report covers details of the small volume radiocarbon samples. 
The AMS station locations are shown in Figure 1 and summarized in Table 1. A total 
of 882 Delta-14C samples were collected at 33 stations.

2.0	PERSONNEL

14C sampling for this cruise was carried out by J. Green and E. Houzel from U. 
Washington. 14C analyses were performed at the National Ocean Sciences AMS 
Facility (NOSAMS) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. G. Thomas (AOML) 
analyzed salinity; K. Hargraves and D. Jones (PMEL) analyzed oxygen. Nutrients 
were analyzed by K. Krogslund (UW) and C. Mordy (PMEL). 13C analyses were run in 
P. Quay's lab (U. Washington). Key collected the data from the originators, merged 
the files, assigned quality control flags to the 14C and submitted the data files 
to the WOCE office (8/98). Paul Quay is P.I. for the 13C and 14C data.

3.0	RESULTS

This 14C data set and any changes or additions supersedes any prior release.

3.1	HYDROGRAPHY

Hydrography from this leg has been submitted to the WOCE office by the chief 
scientist and described in the hydrographic report.

3.2	14C

The Delta-14C values reported here were originally distributed in a NOSAMS data 
report (NOSAMS, 1998), June 19, 1998. That reports included preliminary results 
which had not been through the WOCE quality control procedures. This report 
supersedes that data distribution.

All of the AMS samples from this cruise have been measured. Replicate measurements 
were made on 14 water samples. These replicate analyses are tabulated in Table 2. 
The table shows the error weighted mean and uncertainty for each set of 
replicates. Uncertainty is defined here as the larger of the standard deviation 
and the error weighted standard deviation of the mean. For these replicates, the 
simple average of the normal standard deviations for the replicates is 4.9%o. This 
precision estimate is approximately correct for the time frame over which these 
samples were measured (Aug. 1996 - Apr. 1998). Note that the errors given for 
individual measurements in the final data report (with the exception of the 
replicates) include only counting errors, and errors due to blanks and 
backgrounds. The uncertainty obtained for replicate analyses is a better estimate 
of the true error which includes errors due to sample collection, sample 
degassing, etc. For a detailed discussion of this see Key (1996).

4.0	QUALITY CONTROL FLAG ASSIGNMENT

Quality flag values were assigned to all Delta-14C measurements using the code 
defined in Table 0.2 of WHP Office Report WHPO 91-1 Rev. 2 section 4.5.2. (Joyce, 
et al., 1994). Measurement flags values of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 have been assigned. 
The choice between values 2 (good), 3 (questionable) or 4 (bad) involves some 
interpretation. There is little overlap between this data set and any existing 14C 
data, so that type of comparison was difficult. In general the lack of other data 
for comparison led to a more lenient grading on the 14C data.

When using this data set for scientific application, any 14C datum which is 
flagged with a "3" should be carefully considered. My subjective opinion is that 
any datum flagged "4" should be disregarded. When flagging 14C data, the 
measurement error was taken into consideration. That is, approximately one-third 
of the 14C measurements are expected to deviate from the true value by more than 
the measurement precision (~4.9%o). No measured values have been removed from this 
data set, therefore a flag value of 5 implies that the sample was totally lost 
somewhere between collection and analysis. Table 3 summarizes the quality control 
flags assigned to this data set. For a detailed description of the flagging 
procedure see Key, et al. (1996).

5.0	DATA SUMMARY

Figures 2-5 summarize the Delta-14C data collected on this leg. Only Delta-14C 
measurements with a quality flag value of 2 ("good") or 6 ("replicate") are 
included in each figure. Figure 2 shows the Delta-14C values with 2-sigma error 
bars plotted as a function of pressure. The mid depth Delta-14C minimum which 
normally occurs around 2500 meters in most of the Pacific is absent in this 
section except at the northern end and it is weak there. In the main thermocline 
the results cluster into two distinct bands. The band with higher concentration 
result from ventilation via mode and intermediate waters. Figure 3 shows the 
Delta-14C values plotted against silicate.The straight line shown in the figure is 
the least squares regression relationship derived by Broecker et al. (1995) based 
on the GEOSECS global data set. According to their analysis, this line (Delta-14C 
= -70 - Si) represents the relationship between naturally occurring radiocarbon 
and silicate for most of the ocean. They interpret deviations in Delta-14C above 
this line to be due to input of bomb-produced radiocarbon, however, they note that 
the interpretation can be problematic at high latitudes. The points falling above 
the line with silicate concentrations greater than 100 µm/kg clearly illustrate 
the departure for waters from the Southern Ocean. Samples collected from shallow 
depths show an upward curving trend with decreasing silicate values reflecting the 
addition of bomb produced 14C.

*Figure 2: Delta-14C results for P18 stations shown with 2-sigma error bars. Only 
	those measurements having a quality control flag value of 2 or 6 are 
	plotted.

Figure 4 compares the surface Delta-14C values for P18 to those from the 
southeastern Pacific GEOSECS data set. The greatest change in concentration is in 
the 30°S to 45°S latitude range and at 20°N where the Delta-14C levels decreased 
by approximately 50%o. The low latitude region shows essentially no change since 
GEOSECS.

Figure 5 shows contoured sections of the Delta-14C distribution along the cruise 
track. The "A" portion shows the upper kilometer of the section and "B" the 
remainder of the water column. The data were gridded using the "loess" methods 
described in Chambers et al. (1983), Chambers and Hastie (1991), Cleveland (1979) 
and Cleveland and Devlin (1988). Figure 6 shows the same data as Figure 5A except 
the section is plotted in potential density (sigma-theta) - latitude space. For 
this section, the maximum Delta-14C concentration was found at the surface except 
for a few stations between 20°S and 5°S. Both Figure 5A and Figure 6 clearly 
indicate those surfaces which are being directly ventilated by contact with the 
surface.

*Figure 3: Delta-14C as a function of silicate for P18 AMS samples. The straight 
	line shows the relationship proposed by Broecker, et al., 1995 (Delta-14C 
	= -70 - Si with radiocarbon in %o and silicate in µmol/kg).

	comparison the GEOSECS data from the southeastern Pacific are also

	on which Delta-14C was measured.

APPENDIX 5a.:  CFC-11 and CFC-12 Measurements on WOCE P18 (CGC94) 
(Following discussion provided by J. Bullister, PMEL)

CFC Sampling Procedures and Data Processing

CFCs were usually the first water sample collected from the 10 liter bottles.  
Care was taken to co-ordinate the sampling of CFCs with other gas samples to 
minimize the time between the initial opening of each bottle and the completion 
of sample drawing.  In most cases, helium, tritium, dissolved oxygen, total CO2, 
alkalinity and pH samples were collected within several minutes of the initial 
opening of each bottle.  CFC samples were collected in 100 ml precision glass 
syringes, and held immersed in a water bath until processing.

The CFC analytical system functioned relatively well during this expedition.  
The CFC system was installed in a specially designed laboratory van located on 
deck, and was isolated from possible contamination from high levels of CFCs 
which are sometimes present in air inside ship laboratories.  Concentration of 
CFCs in air inside this van were usually close to those of clean marine air.

Concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air samples, seawater and gas standards 
on the cruise were measured by shipboard electron capture gas chromatography, 
according to the methods described by Bullister and Weiss (1988).  The 
concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air, seawater samples and gas standards 
are reported relative to the SIO 1993 calibration scale.  CFC concentrations in 
air and standard gas are reported in units of mole fraction CFC in dry gas, and 
are typically in parts-per-trillion (ppt) range.  Dissolved CFC concentrations 
are given in unit of picomole CFC per kg seawater (pmol/kg).  CFC concentrations 
in air and seawater samples were determined by fitting their chromatographic 
peak areas to multi-point calibration curves, generated by injecting known 
volumes of gas from a CFC working standard (PMEL cylinder 71489) into the 
analytical instrument.  This concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in this working 
standard were calibrated versus a primary CFC standard (CC36743) before and 
after the cruise.  No measurable drift in the working standard could be detected 
during this interval.  Full range calibration curves were run at 1 to 2 day 
intervals.  Single injections of a fixed volume of standard gas were run much 
more frequently (at intervals of 1 to 2 hours) to monitor short term changes in 
detector sensitivity.  The estimated reproducibility of the calibrations is 
about 1.3% for CFC-11 and 0.5% for CFC-12.  We estimate a precision (1 standard 
deviation) for dissolved CFC measurements of about 1%, or 0.005 pmol/kg, 
whichever is greater (see listing of replicate samples).

Sample loops filled with CFC-free gas, and syringe samples of CFC-free water 
(degassed in a specially designed glass chamber) were run to check sampling and 
analytical blanks.  CFC-11 and CFC-12 were present throughout the water column 
south of about 50°S.  CFC concentrations measured in deep samples (>2000 m) 
along the section north of 40°S were typically in the range of 0 to 0.010 
pmol/kg, near the detection limit of the analytical system (~0.004 pmol/kg). 
Previous studies (Wisegarver et al, et al 1993) of time-dependent tracers in 
this region of the Pacific indicate that waters at densities sigma0>27.4 should 
have CFC concentrations near zero at present.  We attribute the low level CFC 
signal present in some deep samples along the northern end of the section to the 
slow release of CFC from the walls and O-rings of the 10 liter bottles into the 
seawater sample during storage, and to contamination during the transfer and 
storage of the seawater samples in glass syringes prior to analysis. Based on 
the median concentrations observed in deep water samples along northern end of 
the section, a CFC-11 blank correction of 0.0086 pmol/kg has been applied to the 
CFC-11 data on Leg 2 (Sta 8-87) and 0.0048 pmol/kg for Leg 3 (Sta 88-194).  A 
CFC-12 blank correction of 0.0025 pmol/kg has been applied to the CFC-12 data on 
Leg 2 (Sta 9-87) and 0.0024 for Leg 3 (Sta 89-194).  As a result of these blank 
corrections, some concentrations reported for deep samples are negative.

A number of water samples had anomously high CFC-11 and/or CFC-12 concentrations 
relative to adjacent samples.  These high values appeared to occur more or less 
randomly, and were not clearly associated with other features in the water 
column (eg. elevated oxygen concentrations, salinity features, etc).  In most 
cases, only one of the 2 CFCs measured showed these anomolously high levels.  
This suggests that the high values were due to analytical variability or 
isolated low-level contamination events. These samples are included in this 
report and are flagged as either 3 (questionable) or 4 (bad) measurements.  
Approximately 40 analyses of CFC-11 were assigned a flag of 3 and 161 CFC-11 
samples assigned a flag of 4.  Approximately 14 analyses of CFC-12 were assigned 
a flag of 3 and  61 CFC-12 samples assigned a flag of 4.

A number of samples were analysed for CFC-113 and carbon tetrachloride during 
the cruise.  Because of calibration standard uncertainties and analytical 
problems, the processing of these data have not yet been finalized.  These 
samples are flagged as "5" (not reported).  Those interested in these data 
should contact the John Bullister for updates on the status of the CFC-113 and 
carbon tetrachloride data processing.

APPENDIX 6a. Oxygen Measurement techniques on WOCE P18 (CGC94)

Summary of Oxygen Data for CGC94
Kirk Hargreaves
18 April 1996

1.1	Oxygen
1.1.1	Overview

Oxygen samples were drawn from every bottle for every station (except for some 
of the test casts).  A total of 6191 samples were drawn, including 450 
duplicates.  Five different people drew oxygen samples and four people were 
involved with running samples.  The estimated accuracy is 0.3% plus an estimated 
precision of 0.3 µmol/kg.  Note that precision is sampler dependent and was as 
good as 0.2 µmol/kg for some samplers.  All samples for station 89 are flagged 
as bad because of bad sampling.

Samples were titrated using Carpenter's whole bottle technique (Carpenter, 
1969).  An auto-titrator based on a design by Gernot Friederich (Friederich, 
1991) and using a modified version of Friederich's software was used to titrate 
the samples.  The titrator consists of a Kloehn 50100 Syringe Drive with a 5 ml 
syringe, a home-built photometer, and a computer.  Post- processing software was 
used to add in temperature corrections and to analyze data.

1.1.2	Sampling and pickling

Oxygen sampled immediately after CFC's and Helium.  Samples were drawn in 
calibrated 125 ml nominal volume iodine determination flasks (Corning 5400-125).

The sampling tube was inserted into the flask, allowed to flow freely and tapped 
to removed bubbles, and then inverted.  The tube was pinched to reduce flow and 
allow water in the flask to drain.  A water sheet was formed on the inside of 
the flask, the sampling tube pinched off, the flask drained, and then put right 
side up.  The sampling tube was slowly released to prevent turbulent flow and 
the flask allowd to fill.  Using a watch, the fill time was measured and used to 
ensure at least two flask volumes overflow. (Typical fill time was 7 seconds).  
During this time, the temperature of the water was recorded using an 
uncalibrated Pt-RTD.  However, these temperatures are not used in the final data 
processing.

Reagents were introduced quicky after sampling using Brinckmann 1.0 ml Fixed 
Volume Dispensette repipets.  The tips of the repipets were lengthened using 
clear polyolefin shrink tubing.  How reagents were introduced varied.  My 
preferred method was adding MnCl2 at the bottom of the flask, and NaOH/NaI at 
the mid-point.  The repipet tips were inserted into the flask and then the 
repipets were filled and dispensed.  This had the problem that on the upstroke, 
sometimes seawater (~5 uL) was aspirated up the tube.  In later cruises, the 
upstroke should take place outside of the flask.  All reagents were prepared 
according to WOCE specifications.

Flasks were capped at this point and shaken until the reagents were well mixed.  
The flask was inverted and checked for bubbles.  Distilled water, or later, 
seawater, was added to the collar of the flask and the flask stowed.  At least 
20 minutes after sampling was finished, flasks were reshaken.

1.1.3	Analysis

Samples were analyzed no earlier than 20 minutes and no later than 8 hours after 
remixing.  Liquid from the flask collar was aspirated with a transfer pipette 
and the stopper removed.  ~1ml of 10N sulfuric acid and a rinsed stir bar were 
added. (Note - the stir bars had short lengths of Tygon on them to improve their 
stirring characteristics.  Stir bars without pivot rings have since been found 
to work better.)  The flask was wiped dry and placed in the titrator and 
titrated with 0.05 N sodium thiosulfate.  After titration, the sample was poured 
out and the flask rinsed with hot tap water.

1.1.4	Standardization

Titrant was standardized with 0.01N potassium iodate solution which was mixd 
before the cruise and stored in air tight bottle.  Standard was dispensed using 
a spare Kloehn 50100 with a calibrated 5 ml buret.  The measured accuracy of the 
dispensed standards is 0.6 uL and 2.3 uL for volumes below and above 5 mL, 
respectively.  Standards all were within 0.1% of each their calculated values 
when intercompared after the cruise.

APPENDIX 7.  Bottle Salinity Measurement techniques on WOCE P18 (CGC94)

Bottle salinity measurements on section P18 were made by Gregg Thomas (NOAA-
AOML).  The salinity analysis was accomplished using two Guildline Model 8400A 
inductive autosalinimoters standardized with IAPSO Standard Seawater batch P114.  
The instruments were located in a temperature controlled van.  The 
autosalinometer in use was standardized before each run and either at the end of 
each run or after no more than 48 samples.  The drift between standardizations 
was monitored and the individual samples were corrected for that drift by linear 
interpolation.  Duplicate samples taken from the deepest bottle on each cast 
were analyzedon a subsequent day. Bottle salinities were compared with 
preliminary CTD salinities to aid in identification of leaking bottles as well 
as to monitor the CTD conductivity cells' performance and drift.

The expected precision of the autosalinometer with an accomplished operator is 
0.001 pss, with an accuracy of 0.003.  To assess the precision of discrete 
salinity measurements on this cruise, a comparison is made for data from the 
instances in which two bottles were tripped within 10 dbar of each other at the 
same station below a depth of 2000 dbar.  For the 138 instances in which both 
bottles of the pair have acceptable salinity measurements, the standard 
deviation of the differences is 0.0012 pss.  This value is very close to the 
expected precision.

APPENDIX 8.  Nutrient Measurement techniques on WOCE P18 (CGC94)

	Nutrients
	by KA Krogslund and C. W. Mordy (8 May, 1996)

Equipment and Analytical Methods

An Alpkem RFA/2(trademark) autoanalyzer was used to determine dissolved 
concentrations of silicate (Si(OH)4), phosphate (HPO4-3) nitrate (NO3-) and 
nitrite (NO2-).  Measurements were made in a temperature controlled laboratory 
which was maintained at 21(±)1°C.  The following analytical methods were 
employed:

Silicate was converted to silicomolybdic acid and reduced with stannous chloride 
to form silicomolybdous acid or molybdenum blue (Armstrong, 1967).

Phosphate was converted to phosphomolybdic acid and reduced with ascorbic acid 
to form phosphomolybdous acid in a reaction stream heated to 37°C (Bernhardt and 
Wilhelms, 1967).

Nitrite was diazotized with sulfanilamide and coupled with NEDA to from a red 
azo dye.

Nitrate+Nitrite was measured by first reducing nitrate to nitrite in a 
copperized cadmium coil, and then analyzing for nitrite.  Nitrate was determined 
from the difference of nitrate+nitrite and nitrite (Armstrong, 1967).

Sampling Procedures

Nutrient samples were collected from 10-liter Niskin bottles in aged 20 ml high 
density polyethylene scintillation vials closed with teflon lined polyethylene 
caps.  All vials and caps were rinsed with 10% HCl and deionized water prior to 
each station, and rinsed at least three times with sample before filling.  
Samples were usually analyzed immediately after collection; however, some 
samples were stored for up to 12 hours at 4-6°C. 

Calibrations and Standards

Standard material for dissolved silicate was sodium fluorosilicate which had 
been referenced against a fused-quartz standard.  Primary standards were 
prepared by dissolving standard material in deionized water, and working 
standards were prepared in low nutrient seawater.  At each station, seven 
concentrations of working standard were freshly prepared and analyzed prior to 
sample analysis, and the highest standard was again analyzed after the last 
sample.  This allowed for regular monitoring of the response, drift and 
linearity of each chemistry.  All analysis were within the linear range of the 
instrument.  Concentrations were converted to µmoles/kg by calculating sample 
densities using the laboratory temperature of 21°C and the practical salinity 
scale (UNESCO, 1981).

Precision

Analytical precision was determined by replicate measurements (usually 4-5 
measurements) on 46 samples from depths greater than 100 m.  The average 
standard deviations of these precision tests were (micromoles/kg) 1.1 silicate, 
0.015 phosphate, and 0.22 nitrate; and the average percent deviations were 0.56% 
silicate, 0.84% phosphate, and 0.59% nitrate.

APPENDIX 9a.  Responses to WOCE DQE of CTD data

Dear Mark,

Thank you for your DQE evaluation of CTD data collected along WOCE section P18.  
We considered each of your suggestions and the following is an itemized 
explanation of what we did or didn't change in our data files, as well as 
answers to your questions.

Kristy McTaggart and Greg Johnson

***************************************************************************

STATION SUMMARY FILE (.sum)

.sum files here were ammended to contain the same maximum pressure values for 
stations 25, 27, 32, 46, 61, and 78 as you listed.

The PDR sound speed used for sounder readings was 1500 m/s.  The readings were 
not corrected for transducer depth below the waterline.  The depth of the 
transducer would've been about 5.5 ± 0.6 m.  We would prefer to use the PDR 
depths as listed and correct them using Carter's tables so that they serve as 
independent measurements and can be used as a check on CTD pressure.

SALINITY

Regarding suspicious CTD salinity data listed in Table 4:

station 24  2-6 dbar	flags not changed to 3
station 51  84 dbar	flag changed to 3
station 52  74 dbar	flag changed to 3
station 53  70 dbar	flag changed to 3
station 55		flags not changed to 3
station 67  46 dbar	flag changed to 3

'Scatter of salinity residuals'

There is an incompatibility between the General Oceanics rosette sampler and the 
Sea-Bird 911plus CTD system that generates a spike in the data stream at the 
moment a bottle is confirmed as tripped.  Because of this, upcast CTD burst data 
had to be averaged prior to the bottle confirm bit.  Two-second averages were 
chosen over a longer interval because the CTD operators did not always let the 
package sit at bottle depth for at least 10 seconds before firing the rosette.  
Hence no changes were made.

'Biasing of CTD salinity data for individual stations'

Of course one can seemingly make a (very slight) improvement in the CTD-bottle 
residual statistics by allowing more degrees of freedom in the fit as the DQE 
has suggested (that is, breaking up the fit into small station groupings).  One 
could get the best statistics by individually fitting each station to its 
bottles, but most experts would argue that this would be a bad choice, because 
one would not be taking advantage of the CTD calibration as a way to average out 
station-to-station bottle salinity noise.

We believe that the SBE-9/11 CTD conductivity slope drifts gradually, and is 
actually more stable than the day-to-day fluctuations in the autosal- inometer 
salinities owing to small temperature drifts in the laboratory and the fact that 
severe budgetary constraints on these cruises forced us to economize even on 
such things as standard sea water.  We suspect that the "biasing of the CTD 
salinity data" mentioned in the DQE evaluations is actually noise in the bottle 
data.  Somewhat suspicious is that the station groupings recommended by the DQE 
of the correct size (most often 3-5 stations per group) that they could easily 
be owing to daily drift problems in the autosalinometer.  For our original 
calibrations we deliberately chose to model the conductivity slope adjustments 
of the entire data sets for P14S/P15S and P18 using 4th-order polynomial 
functions of station number to average out bottle salinity noise.  We did this 
because we saw no obvious jumps in the CTD calibration for either cruise, just 
gradual drifts.

Statistical support for our philosophy over that of the DQE is given by the 
following exercise:  The 2°C potential isotherm is well within the oldest 
Pacific Deep Water, and has some of the tightest Theta-S relation- ships in the 
Pacific Ocean (and probably the world).  For both P18 and P14S/P15S, we looked 
at the absolute values of station-to-station changes in CTD salinity on 
Theta=2.0°C (Figure 1) for our original calibration, creating a histogram of 
station-to-station differences for each cruise in 0.001 bins.  We then applied 
the DQE's suggested ad-hoc calibrations for smaller station groupings to the 
data and conducted the same analysis.  When the histograms are differenced 
(Figure 2), one can see that the Theta-S relations at 2°C after the DQE's 
corrections are noisier for both cruises.  For P18, after the DQE's suggested 
correction there are four less station pairs in the 0.000 difference bin and one 
less in the 0.001 difference bin whereas there are three more in the 0.002 
difference bin and two more in the 0.003 difference bin.  For P15S/P15S there 
are four less stations in the 0.000 difference bin after the DQE's suggested 
correction, with one more in the 0.001 difference bin and three more in the 
0.002 difference bin.  Since the DQE's "corrections" actually introduce more 
noise in the CTD Theta-S relation at 2°C than our original calibration, we 
decline application of them.  The small groups do not improve the calibraiton, 
they degrade, perhaps by introducing auto- salinometer drift noise.

OXYGEN

Rankings for stations as listed in Table 6 were complied with except for station 
160, which is closer to a rating of 2 than 1 and was flagged as 3 not 4.  A 
cutoff of 3750 dbar was used to reflag the deep data of stations 21 and 22; 3400 
dbar for station 65; 3200 dbar for station 67; and 2200 dbar for station 85.  
Note all flags of 6, 7, or 8 were preserved in the
reflagging.

Poor oxygen data were owing to poor sensor performance not to the data 
processing or curve fitting.  A few worst case groupings were reexamined using 
two sets of fit coefficients blended near the oxygen minimum as was done for 
P14S/P15S.  However, there was no significant improvement.  Unfortunately, only 
one oxygen module was available for this cruise due to severe budgetary 
constraints, and it was not a good one.

Suspicious oxygen data listed in Table 5 were examined and near surface data 
were reflagged as 3 as suggested.  Note that data files submitted before and 
after the DQE evaluation are 1 dbar averages, not the 2 dbar averages 
referenced.  For suspicious oxygen data deeper in the water column, these were 
interpolated over and flagged as 6 (stations 30, 69, 70, 71-74, 128, 153, and 
180).  The shift in oxygen data between 2084 and 2384 dbar for station 188 was 
flagged as 3 and not interpolated over.  Again, all flags of 6, 7, or 8 were 
preserved in the reflagging.

Stations 26, 89 and 160 were viewed with adjacent profiles and their bottles.  
Station 26 and 89 oxygen profiles were flagged as 4 as suggested in Table 6.  
Station 160, however, looked to be closer to a rating of 2 than 1 and was 
flagged as 3 not 4.

CTDOXY flags in the .sea file were changed to 4 for all the station samples you 
listed.  Also, CTDOXY flags were changed to 4 where profiles were recently 
interpolated as a result of DQE suggestions:

station	 30	sample	121
	 70		107
	 73		108
	180		111

TEMPERATURE

There is a typo in the data report.  The value of the drift for temperature 
sensor T1461 is -0.0006 C.  Temperature calibrations were applied to the data 
using Seasoft processing module DATCNV which reads the sensor's .con file for 
coefficients.

DESPIKING, INTERPOLATION AND FLAGS

The flag value of 8 used near the surface in the .ctd files represent data that 
were continued to the surface from the first assumed good value.  For P14S/P15S 
we used 7.  For P18, this procedure was done in program POSTCAL where temp, 
cond, oxc and oxt were copied back and flagged as 8, then salinity was 
recomputed and flagged as 2 in most cases.  Despiking done after POSTCAL changed 
some flags to 6.  Flags of 8 were left in the data files for this cruise.

As for the large blocks of interpolated data (mostly oxygen) listed in Table 2, 
we maintain that this is the best way to deal with these data from a poor and 
failing sensor.  Flags of 6 (as well as 7 and 8) have been preserved even when 
reflagging the entire oxygen profile as suggested in Table 6.

DENSITY INVERSIONS

Original data submitted for P18 were not examined for small density inversions.  
In response to the DQE evaluation, program DELOOP, as applied to P14S/P15S, with 
an N^2 criteria of -3x10e¯6 was applied to P18 profiles.  Over 82% of the 
density inversions listed in Table 7 were interpolated over.  Delooped 1 dbar 
averaged data files with all the changes noted above are resubmitted along with 
this reply to the DQE.

DOCUMENTATION

Again, the PDR sound speed was 1500 m/s, and the readings have not been 
corrected for transducer depth (5.5 ± 0.6 m) below the waterline.

Station groupings used for oxygen calibrations and final values of fit 
parameters are given in a separate oxygen calibration table.

Oxygen calibration problems were owing to poor sensor performance.

Temperature pre- and post-cruise calibration difference for sensor T1461 was a 
typo in the documentation and should read -0.0006°C.

More frequent flagging of surface temperatures compared to surface salinities is 
explained in the previous section, DESPIKING, INTERPOLATION AND FLAGS.

Data files submitted to the WOCE office were 1 dbar averages, not 2 dbar.

P18 Data Quality Control: Nutrients

C.W. Mordy response to Mantyla Evaluation

Edits Resulting from Mantyla's Comments:

Sta 23: Silicates flagged as uncertain.  Same and Mantyla

Sta 86 & 87: Deep PO4s and NO3s are higher than surrounding stations (85 & 88).  
Flagged Sta 87 bottles 101-119 PO4 & NO3 as uncertain, flagged Sta 86 bottles 
101-118 PO4 & NO3 as uncertain.  Mantyla suggested deep PO4s be flagged 3.

Sta 88: Nitrates flagged as "ok" except for bottles 117 & 101.  Same as Mantyla.

Sta 148: Bottle 126 NO2 flagged as uncertain, same as Mantyla.

Sta 191: Bottle 113 NO2 flagged as uncertain, same as Mantyla.

Zero Silicates: ND would be perhaps more appropriate.  Note that P4, P21 and P6 
all have zero values in the region.  P17E has values of 2-3 uM near the crossing 
while P18 data has lots of scatter.  99 bottles with zero silicates were given 
an uncertain flag.

DQE Evaluation of CTD data for RV Discoverer Cruise along
WOCE Section P18 (S and N)
Expocode 31DSCG94_2 and 31DSCG94_3

Mark Rosenberg, November 1998

This report contains a data quality evaluation of the CTD data files for the 
Pacific sector cruise along WOCE meridional section P18 (S and N) (*Figure 1) on 
the RV Discoverer in February to April, 1994. Bottle data are evaluated by Arnold 
Mantyla in a separate report. The data provide a useful contiguous meridional 
section from Antarctic through to tropical waters.

P18 (1994) and P14S/P15S (1996) CTD data were collected by the same group, and 
several of the problems noted here are shared with the 1996 cruise, and are 
already described in the P14S/P15S DQE report (most notably the biasing of 
salinity data for whole stations). Some of the problems found in the P18 data are 
much improved in the later P14S/P15S cruise data (most notably CTD oxygen data 
quality). 

2 dbar CTD data were examined for stations 10 to 194. CTD files for stations 2 to 
7 from the East Blanco Depression were not available. Upcast CTD burst data in the 
.sea file were examined for all stations. In general, salinity data are of good 
quality, while CTD oxygen data quality is mixed.

Station Summary File (.sum)

  The maximum pressure value for several stations was missing in the .sum file. 
   The following values were obtained from the .ctd files, and inserted into the 
   .sum file:

station	max press
25	4648
27	4832
32	4608
46	3914
61	3866
78	3410

  Sound speed and transducer depth information for the ship's sounder were not 
   provided in the documentation. "Corrected depth" (.sum file) was therefore 
   calculated from the CTD at the bottom of the cast  i.e. altimeter reading + 
   maximum CTD pressure recalculated in meters (using the method of Saunders and 
   Fofonoff, 1976). For stations with no altimeter reading, no corrected depth was 
   calculated. These corrected depth values are in an ascii file corrdepth.dat, 
   and have not been merged into the .sum file.

SALINITY

In the following discussion, only CTD and bottle values with a quality flag of  2 
are considered (i.e. QUALT1=2 for CTDSAL and SALNTY in the .sea file). See Table 4 
for a station by station summary of salinity data problems.

Scatter of salinity residuals

The salinity residual data Delta-S (where Delta-S = bottle - CTD salinity 
difference) for all depths is shown in Figure 2. Outliers were rejected 
iteratively by the data processors, as described in the cruise report. Below 500 
dbar, scatter of Delta-S is greatly reduced (Figure 3). In steep gradients above 
500 dbar, the sign of the residual appears to be consistent in most cases with the 
salinity gradient direction (assuming CTD sensors are below the bottles on the 
rosette package). As for P14S/P15S, I recommend increasing the averaging period 
for CTD burst data to 10 seconds. Obviously there will still be a residual in the 
steepest gradients, however the increased averaging period may help decrease 
residuals in less dramatic gradients when the ship is rolling during bottle stops.

Biasing of CTD salinity data for individual stations

Standard deviations for Delta-S for the whole cruise were calculated from data in 
the .sea file ("uncorrected data" in Table 1). The value of 0.0017, calculated 
using all sampling depths and |Delta-S| < or equal to 0.008, is a reasonable 
estimate of the salinity accuracy for the cruise. The same biasing problem for 
individual stations exists as described in the P14S/P15S DQE report. When the 
cruise is viewed as a whole, the salinity accuracy meets WOCE requirements and 
Delta-S varies about a mean of zero (Figures 2 and 3). However when individual 
stations are examined, there is a clear biasing of CTD salinity data (e.g. stations 
113 to 115 in Figure 3, where Delta-S clearly negative). This biasing is a direct 
result of the conductivity calibration method, where the whole cruise is fitted in 
one group and the fourth order station dependent slope correction fails to fully 
track the variation of conductivity sensor behaviour over the cruise. Breaking down 
the stations into smaller calibration groups is strongly recommended - this would 
allow the station dependent slope correction to remove the bias for individual 
stations.

I've repeated the exercise performed on the P14S/P15S data, doing an extra fit to 
the Delta-S data to demonstrate the advantages of refining station grouping for 
the conductivity calibration - see the P14S/P15S DQE report for the method. The 
resulting Sbtl - Scor residuals for depths below 500 dbar are plotted in Figure 4. 
Standard deviation calculations for these "corrected" data are shown in Table 1.

There is only a small improvement to standard deviations calculated for the whole 
cruise (Table 1), however there is a marked improvement to the biasing of 
individual stations (Figure 5 shows some examples). Clearly, breaking down a 
cruise into smaller station groups for the calibration of CTD conductivity 
significantly improves the calibration. As for P14S/P15S, the correction done here 
is only a rough version - for a real calibration on selected station groups, 
groups would be selected with a linear variation of station mean Delta-S, allowing 
the station dependent slope correction to take effect within each group and giving 
even better calibration results.

Table 1:Standard deviations for salinity residuals Delta-S (using only bottle and 
	CTD data for which the quality flag=2), where "uncorrected data" are as 
	submitted to WHPO, and corrected data are with additional Delta-S fit 
	applied.

data			standard deviation of		standard deviation of
			Delta-S, uncorrected data	Delta-S, corrected data
all depths		0.0034				0.0033
deeper than 500 dbar	0.0010				0.0009
all depths, |Delta-S|	0.0017				0.0016
	< or equal to 0.008

Deepwater theta-S curves

Comparing adjacent stations on deepwater theta-S curves, no outlying stations 
were found.

OXYGEN

Oxygen residual data (i.e. bottle - CTD oxygen difference) are plotted in Figure 
6, noting that large outliers lie beyond the axis limits on the graph. CTD oxygen 
data quality is in general not good, particularly when compared with the excellent 
quality for P14S/P15S. From examination of oxygen residual profiles for all 
stations, the calibration is acceptable for only ~40% of stations. The curve-
fitting results are often poor when compared to bottle profiles, and constant 
offsets also occur. In many cases oxygen features which persist in the bottle data 
for a number of consecutive stations are not well described by the CTD oxygen 
traces e.g. the feature around 2000 dbar for stations 125 to 148; and the feature 
around 2500 dbar for stations 184 to 191 (Figure 7 shows examples). Table 6 ranks 
the calibration quality of each station on a scale from 1 (bad) to 5 (good). I 
suggest the following flagging for the entire CTD oxygen data in the .ctd files:

  stations ranked 5 or 4 are acceptable (accurate to within ~1%)
  stations ranked 3 or 2 should be flagged as 3 (accurate to within ~2.5%)
  stations ranked 1 should be flagged as 4

It is hard to tell from the data set whether the poor CTD oxygen data quality is 
due to poor oxygen sensor performance, or else due to the data processing and 
curve fitting. From the data report, the processing methodology appears simpler 
than for the later P14S/P15S cruise - notably, there isn't the blending of 2 sets 
of fit coefficients as for P14S/P15S. I'd be interested in a comment from the data 
processors about the source of the problem.

Other relevant notes are as follows:

  The near surface (top ~100 dbar) CTD oxygen data is often unreliable; the top 
   ~40 dbar should be treated with particular caution.
  Many stations appear to have suspicious oxygen data for the top few bins, due to 
   transient sensor errors as the instrument enters the water and the pump winds 
   up. Stations where these errors are greater than ~4 µmol/kg, and where there is 
   no matching T/S feature, are summarised in Table 5. The table also includes 
   suspicious data from deeper down, and a flag of 3 is recommended where these 
   glitches are greater than ~4 µmol/kg.
  For stations 168 to 189, the oxygen sensor has trouble responding to the rapid 
   fall of oxygen concentration towards zero below the thermocline, a problem 
   common to membrane type sensors in the oxygen depleted layer.
  Stations 26, 89, 111 and 160 have no oxygen bottle samples. CTD oxygen data 
   does not compare well with surrounding stations for 26, 89 and 160, and a flag 
   4 is recommended for the entire CTD oxygen profile; surprisingly, station 111 
   does compare well with surrounding stations.
  In some cases where CTD oxygen data have been "despiked" in the .ctd file, the 
   unspiked data have been transferred to the CTDOXY value in the .sea file. This 
   occurs for the following samples:

station	sample		station	sample
15	128		171	136
13	136		172	336,335
20	129,128,126	173	136
22	127		184	136
35	136		185	136,135
48	124		190	136,133
166	136
167	136,135
168	336
169	108,107,106,105
170	136,135

CTDOXY values for these samples should all be flagged as 4 in the .sea file.

TEMPERATURE

The data report states that data from temperature sensor T1461 were used for 
stations 9-194, and that "post-cruise calibrations showed T1461 to be drifting 
(offset only) by approximately -0.006°C". I am confused about this statement, as 
the report goes on to say that "T1460 had jumped by 0.002°C, warranting repair". 
If the pre and post cruise calibrations for sensor T1461 indeed differ by .006°, 
this is of great concern: is this the correction done by the program POSTCAL? I'd 
appreciate if the data processors would clarify this.

DESPIKING, INTERPOLATION AND FLAGS

A flag value of 8 has often been used near the surface in the .ctd files. This is 
an unassigned value. I assume that this was supposed to be the "despiking" flag 7, 
akin to the flag used for near surface data in the P14S/P15S data, where data has 
been continued to the surface from the first assumed good value. Note that for P18 
data, this occurs more often for temperature than for salinity data (vice versa 
for P14S/P15S) - I'd be interested in a comment from the data processors here i.e. 
I would have expected both parameters to be simultaneously flagged out in most 
cases.

Large blocks of interpolated data (flag 6 in the .ctd files) occur, often in steep 
gradients, and over intervals up to 200 dbar. Linear interpolation is really only 
justified over small vertical intervals, and preferrably not in steep gradients. 
The worst instances are listed in Table 2 below. In all the cases listed, it's 
better to either leave a data gap and flag as 5 (my recommendation), or else leave 
the bad data in and flag as bad.

DENSITY INVERSIONS

Locations of unstable vertical density gradients are shown in Figure 8; only 
gradients more unstable than -0.003 kg/m3/dbar are shown. Density gradient values 
for these instabilities are summarised in Table 7. The vertical profiles were 
inspected for the 5 worst cases (more unstable than -0.015 kg/m3/dbar): in these 
cases, the instabilities are due to wake water from the package passing the 
sensors. Many of the smaller instabilities may be due to the same effect.

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER CRUISES

Deepwater theta-S and theta-oxygen curves were compared for P18 stations 
coincident with other cruise data sets (Table 3), as follows. Note that only a 
limited number of stations occur at the crossovers. In general, theta-S agreement 
lies within the expected inter-cruise accuracy of 0.002. Oxygen agreement is 
within 2% of deepwater oxygen values.

Table 3:Stations from different cruises used for comparison with P18.

	P18N and P4E (P.I. H. Bryden on eastern leg) (Figure 9)
P4E salinity is higher than P18 by ~0.0015
Oxygen data compare well below theta=2.2°

	P18N and P21 (P.I. M. McCartney on eastern leg) (Figure 9)
P21 salinity is higher than P18 by ~0.002.
Oxygen data compare well below theta=2.2° for the two P21 stations and one of the 
P18 stations; the second P18 station is lower  by ~3 µmol/kg above theta=1.55°, and 
agrees below this.

	P18S and P6E (P.I. H. Bryden on eastern leg) (Figure 9)
P6E salinity is lower than P18 by ~0.001.
Oxygen comparison is inconclusive: P6E is ~2.5 µmol/kg higher than P18, but 
converges at the bottom.

	P18S and P17E (P.I. J. Swift) (Figure 10)
P17E salinity is higher than P18 by ~0.001 to 0.002 below the deepwater salinity 
maximum. Oxgen data compare fairly well below theta=1.3°

	P18S and S4P (P.I Koshlyakov) (Figure 10)
S4P salinity is lower than P18 by ~0.002.
Oxygen data for S4P at the crossover is too noisy for a fair comparison.

DOCUMENTATION

CTD data processing methodology is in general well described. It would be useful 
to add the following information:

  sound speeds used for sounder readings, and whether or not readings have been 
   corrected for transducer depth below the waterline;
  station groupings used for oxygen calibration, and final values of fit 
   parameters.

Comments on the following would be appreciated, as discussed in previous sections:

  oxygen calibration problem (i.e. sensor, or fitting problem);
  temperature pre and post cruise calibration difference for sensor T1461;
  more frequent flagging of surface T data compared to surface S data (opposite 
   to cruise P14S/P15S).

Lastly, the methodology in the report discusses 1 dbar averaging. Are the 2 dbar 
data submitted to the WOCE office derived from the same raw data level, or are 
they somehow extracted from 1 dbar data?

DQ EVALUATION OF WOCE P18S AND P18N HYDROGRAPHIC DATA

Arnold W. Mantyla

WOCE line P18 began in the southern Amundson Basin at the same latitude as WOCE 
line S04 and then extended northward, mostly along the eastern flank of the East 
Pacific Rise, ending near Cabo San Lucas at the tip of Baja California, Mexico.  
The cruise resulted in an excellent section across the frontal zones of the 
Antarctic Circumpolar Current and through the very low oxygen minimum zones of 
the Eastern Pacific on both sides of the equator.  About 85% of the 185 stations 
from the two legs (P18S and P18N) were done with a 35 place rosette that 
provided good full water column water sample coverage.  Except for one station 
where no water samples were recovered, the rest were done with a 24 place 
rosette system, usually at times of rough weather.  The latter stations had a 
higher data loss than the fair weather stations done with the larger system.

The cruise track crossed 5 other WOCE lines: S04, P17E, P06, P21, and P04, as 
well as the two classical Scorpio lines.  Comparison of data at the crossings 
indicated the P18 cruise tended to be slightly lower in salinity, oxygen, 
silicate, phosphate, and nitrate than the other WOCE cruises, but the 
differences were within the combined expected precision of the cruise pairs.

Overall, the data looks quite good, and the data originators have done a 
thorough job in checking the data.  However, some of the data rejection may have 
been overly zealous, particularly with the salinity flags.  About a third of the 
doubtful salinities were clearly due to sample collection errors, usually off by 
one depth. These were not rosette trip errors, as revealed by the oxygen and 
nutrient profiles.  They would be ok if shifted to their CTD verified depths.  
Of the remaining questioned salinities, about 40% were within one depth of the 
primary nitrite maximum in the upper thermocline (the secondary NO2 max is 
associated with the deeper very low O2's).  The primary NO2 max is usually in 
the maximum stability zone, or in the strongest density gradient below the 
surface layer.  Both temperature and salinity can also have strong vertical 
gradients there and it is in that area that the CTD and the water samples often 
have trouble in seeing the same answer, for a variety of reasons.  The fact that 
the two measurements often differ does not mean that either is bad and some 
judgement should be used before rejecting data that in all likelihood is ok.  I 
have changed a few of the flags to ok, but for the most part have left the flags 
as done by the data originators.  Also, water samples collected near a sharp 
salinity minimum or maximum at times seemed to be more extreme than the CTD and 
therefore flagged questionable, but I believe that they shouldn't be flagged, so 
I changed some of the flags to ok.

There appears to be a small CTD salinity bias that varied with depth, the 
surface CTD being about .001 too low at the surface, and about .001 too high at 
the bottom.  Mark Rosenberg has noted the problem in his CTD DQE evaluation, so 
the CTD salinities should be corrected at the rosette trip levels also.

Five stations had sample collection errors by being off one level for part of 
the sample drawing of the salinities (sta.'s 107, 112, and 140), O2 (sta. 169), 
and nutrients (sta. 23).  Since the CTD verifies the correct depths for the 
salinity and oxygen samples, I can't see why the samples couldn't be shifted to 
the correct depths, as long as that was noted in the cruise report.  The 
nutrient offset is apparent from comparison with the nutrient vs density profile 
on the adjacent stations.

Many stations had surface layer silicates listed as zero, unlike any in the 
bracketing WOCE lines P17E and P19, or most other recent expeditions. I flagged 
the first station (32) zero silicates uncertain, but did not flag any of the 
other 27 stations that had unlikely zero surface silicate values.  It seems the 
autoanalizer baseline correction may have been too large on many stations, or 
perhaps there was a problem with low level detection.  I don't believe the zero 
values, but have decided to let them go as is.

There were a number of curious isolated depths where only oxygen was listed, but 
no salinity or nutrients.  Salinities should always be collected and listed, as 
that is the essential sample in verification of the correct tripping of the 
rosette bottle.

The following are comments on specific stations with problems that should be 
looked into:

Sta. 23: 1995-4740db - silicates are higher than adjacent stations at the same 
density, it looks like they belong one depth deeper.  Phosphate and nitrate 
gradients are too weak to tell, they would look ok at wither depth.  Suspect a 
sample drawing error similar to those later (S and O2) verified by the CTD.  As 
listed, the silicates should be flagged "uncertain", they would look ok if 
listed one depth deeper. 

Sta. 40: 9-363db - Water sample salinity and oxygen data compared to the CTD 
indicate that samples 326-335 belong one depth deeper.  Looks like samples 326 
and 325 both tripped at 363db, with subsequent trips then one depth deeper than 
intended, and then only one trip at 9db (sample 336) instead of a double trip 
there.  Suggest re-list the data with the correct pressures and temperatures and 
change the questionable salinity flags to data ok flags.

Sta.'s 85-88 PO4's: The deep phosphate for the last two stations of P18S appear 
high compared to station 85 and to the first station on P18N (sta. 88) The 
calculations should be checked, and if ok I recommend that stas 86 and 87 deep 
PO4's be flagged uncertain.  Also, the deep nitrites on sta. 88 were flagged 
"bad", but they look OK, so I changed the flags to OK, except for two slightly 
high values which were flagged uncertain.

Sta. 107: 200-1303db - The salinity samples from bottles 114 to 128 clearly 
belong one depth shallower.  Numerous salinities were flagged "bad", but if 
moved up one level (and average 128 and 129), the data would be all ok. This is 
a clear sample collection error, as the O2 and nutrients confirm they were not a 
mis-trip.

Sta 112: 1800-2200db - Salinity samples 113 and 114 clearly belong one depth 
deeper, the missing salinity should be at 1801db, rather than at 2201db. Data 
would be ok if moved.  Oxygen confirms not a mis-trip.

Sta 117: 123db - Salinity listed as .0000, should change it to -9.000.

Sta. 140: 602-3748db - As on sta. 107, many salts flagged either questionable or 
bad.  The CTD verifies that samples 103 to 119 are from one depth shallower and 
both 119 and 120 are from 602db.  If moved, all of the salts would be ok.  Not a 
mis-trip, per O2 data.

Sta. 148: 301db - This level is clearly a mis-trip or a leaker, and the water 
did not come from here.  Therefore, the oxygen and nitrite should also be 
flagged uncertain, even though they would seem to "fit" at this depth.

Sta. 169: 1998-3001db - Clear oxygen sampling error, samples 105 to 108 belong 
one depth shallower (108 and 109 are both from 1998db), as confirmed by the CTD.  
If moved, the data would be ok, otherwise they are clearly "bad".

Sta. 190: 99 and 1800db - It looks like the salinity samples 110 and 132 belong 
in reverse order, but I don't have a clue how that error could have happened.

Sta. 191: 699db - A clear mis-trip or leaker, so O2 and NO2 must be flagged 
uncertain also.  The samples are not from this depth.

Sta. 192: 100-1601db - There is no oxygen listed form sample 104 at 1601db; the 
CTD verifies that samples 105 to 107 belong one depth deeper, and no O2 listed 
for sample 107.  If moved, the data would be ok.
