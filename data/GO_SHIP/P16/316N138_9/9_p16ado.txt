A.4  Scientific Programme and Methods

RV Knorr departed Papeete, Tahiti on 6 October, 1992 to extend southward the 
WOCE Pacific sections P16 and P17 completed by the RV Washington TUNES 
expedition during August, 1991. Two equipment shakedown stations were done 
enroute to the first scheduled station at 37.5 S, 150.5 W, a reoccupation of 
TUNES station 180. Both shakedown stations were 36-place 10-liter rosette/CTD 
casts to the bottom with duplicate sampling of the standard hydrographic water 
samples. A summary of the duplicate analyses is given in Table 3. Station 2 was 
at 32 S, near the WOCE P6 line completed in June 1992 as part of this same 
Knorr voyage. Data from the P6 line was not yet available for comparison with 
this cruise data.

From station 3 the cruise track ran south taking stations at 30 minutes of 
latitude (~55 km) intervals along 150.5 W, intending to  reach the vicinity of 
WOCE line S4 at 67°S completed by the Soviet vessel Ioffe in March 1992. 
However, the ice pack was still near its maximum seasonal extent during the 
Austral early spring. Large icebergs were first seen at about 58S, and 
streamers of pancake sea ice 4 miles south of station 53 at 62.5°S forced the 
Captain to turn around for safety reasons. The ship hove to during the short 
nights while it was in the vicinity of ice and bergs for the next week.  From 
sta. 53, the ship steamed eastward, taking two small volume stations on the 
dead-heading run to the corner stations at 62.5 S, 135 W in the Amundsen Basin. 
The gerard and rosette casts were unusually far apart on stations 56 because 
the ship had to move to avoid a rampaging iceberg; the iceberg was 5 miles away 
at the start of the deep deep gerard cast and had closed to within 2 miles by 
the end of the cast. From station 56, an arc of station positions was laid out 
roughly normal to the trend of the Pacific Antarctic Ridge. Station 71 was at 
the crest of the ridge. The rational for this line of stations was two-fold: to 
examine any possible Ross Sea bottom water flow along the flanks of the rise 
upstream of the Udintsev and Eltanin Fracture Zone systems; and to have a line 
of stations under- neath the 10-day repeat satellite track to compare 
geostrophic sea-surface elevation and satellite altimetry. Earlier satellite 
tracked drifter tracks and sea level elevations from satellite altimetry have 
indicated the presence of recurrent eddies near the ridge. From station 71, a 
single station was done to the bottom of the Udintsev Fracture Zone on the long 
deadheading run to start at 56S the northward run of the WOCE P17 line along 
135°W. Station spacing of 30 minute latitude intervals was resumed until the 
TUNES 179 repeat station was reached at 33°S (sta.119). During the northward 
run, the ship discovered it had a 50% greater speed capability than it had on 
the southward run, with the result the planned WOCE work was completed 3 days 
ahead of schedule. The extra available ship time was used to flesh out the 
historical deep station array by taking a few deep stations in the data sparse 
regions in the deep trough between the Austral Islands and the Tuamotu 
Archipelago, avoiding areas covered by P6, SCORPIO, TUNES, GEOSECS, and PHOENIX 
expeditions. Having completed 127 stations, the number originally planned prior 
to the cruise, we arrived ahead of schedule in Papeete on the afternoon of 25 
November, 1992 local time.

Preliminary results:

The major features observed were the salinity minimum of the Intermediate 
Water, the deep oxygen minimum and nutrientmaxima extending southward, the 
salinity maximum and the colder bottom water extending northward.

There was a cold and thick surface layer (less than -1 C) south of about 55°S 
on the 150°W section but a few days later there was a warm cap at the surface 
at 56°S on the 135°W section.

The minimum salinity was at the surface south of 55°S on both sections and 
extended down to about 800-1000m morth of there North of about 44 S there was a 
layer of maximim oxygen just above it.

The great oxygen minimum from the North Pacific was at about 1900-2400 m morth 
of 50°S and rose to about 500m at 62°S. The nitrate and phosphate maxima were 
at about the same depth but the silica maximum was a little deeper. The nitrate 
and phosphate maxima rose to abut 300m near 60°S.

The layer of salinity maximum which extends northward is relatively high in 
oxygen and low in nutrients. It lies near 500-600 m at 62°S and slopes downward 
to 4000m along 150°W. Along 135°W it intersects the bottom near 45°S. It 
appears as a minimum above the bottom in all three nutrients below their maxima 
between 60°S and 50°S and extends as a minimum above the bottom past 33°S in 
silica. 

Along 135°W water denser than 45.92 in sigma-sub-4 and and below 0.9° in 
potential temperature is not found north of the East Pacific Rise, but along 
150°W values as high as 45.97 and below 0.8°C extend beyone 37°S.

Bottle depth distributions

The depth distributions for small volume samples along 150°W are shown in Fig. 
3, and along 135°W in Fig. 4.

 
A.5  Major Problems and Goals not Achieved

As is common to most CTD/rosette cruises, a great deal of water sample data was 
lost due to a variety of rosette malfunctions; on only about one third of the 
stations did the rosette successfully get a good sample from every intended 
depth. About 200 planned sampling depths were lost. It was a continual 
challenge to identify mis-trips quickly in order to get the 
bottle/lanyard/pylon problem repaired before too many stations were done with 
the same malfunction and data loss. Aside from problems easily spotted visually 
upon the cast retrieval such as one or both lids open, fouled lanyards, or non-
trips; other bottle malfunctions were identified by comparison of the bottle 
water sample salinity with the CTD salinity recorded at the time of the bottle 
trip; by outlyers seen on the autoanalyzer analog trace peak heights as the 
samples were being run; and by unusual rosette bottle water temperatures 
recorded as the oxygen samples were being drawn. The "oxy draw temp" proved to 
be an invaluable aid in quickly spotting pre-tripped rosette bottles: where the 
rosette water sample was much colder than the in- situ temperature, the bottle 
must have tripped deeper in the water column than intended. Later availability 
of nutrient and salinity data confirmed suspicions initially aroused by the oxy 
draw temps. Pretrips appeared to be a result of lanyard rigging problems, 
allowing the lower bottle end cap to slip closed prematurely and the upper cap 
closing when triggered by the pylon rotor. Pretrips diminished over the course 
of the cruise as lanyards were adjusted. As the cruise progressed, the 
frequency of unplanned double trips increased. The pylon tripping problem was 
traced late in the cruise to some bent shafts in the spring loaded release pins 
causing temporary hangups until the pylon rotor triggered the next sample. The 
double trips were verified by comparison of both the water sample salinity and 
oxygen with the CTD salinity and oxygen traces.

The CTD winch slip-rings failed a couple of times and excessive electrical line 
noise forced a switch to the backup hydrographic winch for most of the cruise. 
The CTD signal was clean from that winch.

Moderately rough weather made recovery of the CTD/rosette difficult at times. 
The package swung so wildly in the air that the CTD cable was bent where it 
swung against the sheave guards. Frequent cable end reterminations were done, 
severely depleting stocks of spare parts. Station 7 lost the CTD signal on the 
up cast after only 7 bottles were tripped. Because the ship seemed to be behind 
schedule and the down CTD trace was OK, it was decided to not repeat the cast 
for the rest of the water samples. A freak wave on the 20th of October damaged 
the starboard garage door on the aft hangar. Another one on the next day 
completely demolished the door. The area was boarded up for the remainder of 
the cruise. The hangar contained the LVS extraction barrels, which were not 
damaged. Operations continued by using the aft door.

The major goal not achieved on the cruise was the inability to extend the P16 
line closer to Antarctica It was early in the season, February would have been 
better. Many in the scientific party had worked farther into thin sea ice on 
other expeditions, so it was disappointing to turn around so far north.

Calibrated Pressure-Series CTD Data Processing Summary and Comments
(Mary C. Johnson/ODF)
October 10, 1994


1.  Introduction

This document describes the CTDO data acquisition, calibration, and
other processing techniques used on WOCE92-P16A/P17A, also known as JUNO1
and Knorr 138/9.  This WOCE leg was done on the R/V Knorr from October 6 -
November 25, 1992.


2.  CTD Acquisition and Processing Summary

128 CTD casts and several test casts were done during JUNO1.  The
rosette used was an ODF-designed 36-bottle system with a ring of twelve
10-liter bottles and 12- and 24-place General Oceanics pylons nested inside
a ring of twenty-four 10-liter bottles.  A CTD, altimeter, pinger and
transmissometer were mounted on the bottom of the frame.  ODF CTDs #1 and
#2, modified NBIS Mark III-B instruments, were both used during the leg.

Each ODF CTD acquired data at a rate of 25 Hz.  The data consisted of
pressure, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, second temperature,
four CTD voltages, trip confirmation, transmissometer, altimeter and
elapsed time.

An ODF-designed deck unit demodulated the FSK CTD signal to an RS-232
interface.  The raw CTD data signal was split into three paths: to be
logged in raw digitized form, to be monitored in real time as raw data, and
to be processed and plotted.  During the JUNO1 expedition, a Sun
SPARCstation 2 computer served as the real-time data acquisition processor.
Various Sun SPARC computers were used during post-cruise processing as
well.

The analog CTD audio signal was recorded on VHS videotape, and all
digital binary data were logged on a hard disk and then backed up to
cartridge tape.  In addition, all intermediate versions of processed data
were backed up to cartridge tape.

CTD data processing consists of a sequence of steps; some steps are
optional and used only when necessary.  Data can be re-processed from any
point in this sequence after the data have been acquired and stored.  Each
CTD cast is assigned a correction file, and while the corrections are
usually determined for groups of stations, it is possible to fine tune the
parameters for even a single station.  The acquisition and processing steps
are as follows:

o    Data are acquired from the CTD sea cable and assembled into
     consecutive .04-second frames containing all data channels.  The data
     are converted to engineering units.

o    The raw pressure, temperature and conductivity data are passed through
     broad absolute value and gradient filters  to  eliminate  noisy  data.
     Oxygen  data  may also be filtered for noise.  The entire frame of raw
     data is omitted, as opposed to interpolating bad points, if any one of
     the  filters  is  exceeded.  The filters may be adjusted as needed for
     each cast.


                         TYPICAL JUNO1 RAW DATA FILTERS

              Raw Data     |         |         | Frame-to-Frame
              Channel      | Minimum | Maximum |    Gradient   
              -------------|---------|---------|---------------
              Pressure     |   -40   |  6400   |  1-2 decibars 
              -------------|---------|---------|---------------
              Temperature  | -8/-2.5 |  32.7   |  .1-.2 deg.C  
              -------------|---------|---------|---------------
              Conductivity |    0    | 64.355  |   .1-.3 mmho  
              -------------|---------|---------|---------------
              Oxygen@      |    0    |  25000  |    100 amp    

            @ oxygen was filtered for 15 casts only due to winch-
              induced noise problems.


o    Pressure and conductivity are phase-adjusted to match the temperature
     response, since the temperature sensor responds more slowly to change.
     Conductivity data are corrected for ceramic compressibility in
     accordance with the NBIS Mark III-B Reference Manual.

o    The data are averaged into 0.5-second blocks.  During this step, data
     falling outside four standard deviations from the mean are rejected
     and the average is recalculated.  Then data falling outside two
     standard deviations from the new mean are rejected, and the data are
     re-averaged.  The resulting averages, minus second temperature and CTD
     voltages, are reported as the 0.5-second time series.  Secondary
     temperature data are used to verify the stability of the primary
     temperature channel calibration.  Secondary temperature data are only
     filtered, averaged and reported with the time-series data when they
     are used in place of the primary temperature data due to a sensor
     malfunction.

o    Corrections are applied to the data.  The pressure data are corrected
     using laboratory calibration data with the procedure described in
     Appendix A (Delahoyde/Williams).  Temperature corrections, typically a
     quadratic correction as a function of temperature, are based on
     laboratory calibrations.  Conductivity and oxygen corrections are
     derived from water sample data.  Conductivity corrections are
     typically a linear fit as a function of conductivity.  Oxygen data are
     corrected on an individual cast basis using the technique described in
     Appendix B (Delahoyde).  Uncorrected time-series transmissometer data
     are forwarded to TAMU for final processing and reporting.

The averaged data are recorded on hard disk and sent to the real-time
display system, where the data can be reported and plotted during a cast.
The averaging system also communicates with the CTD acquisition computer
for detection of bottle trips, almost always occurring during the up casts.
A 3- to 4-second average of the CTD data is stored for each detected bottle
trip.

A down-cast pressure-series data set is created from the time series
by applying a ship-roll filter to the down-cast time-series data, then
averaging the data within 2-decibar pressure intervals centered on the
reported pressure.  The first few seconds of data for each cast are
generally excluded from the averages due to sensor adjustment or bubbles
during the in-water transition.  Pressure intervals with no time-series
data can optionally be filled by double-parabolic interpolation.  When the
down-cast CTD data have excessive noise, gaps or offsets, the up-cast data
are used instead.  CTD data from down and up casts are not mixed together
in the pressure-series data because they do not represent identical water
columns (due to ship movement, internal waves, wire angles, etc.).

The  CTD  time  series  is  always the primary CTD data record for the
pressure, conductivity and temperature channels.  The final corrections  to
the  CTD oxygen data are made by correcting pressure-series CTD oxygen data
to match the up-cast oxygen water samples at common isopycnals.  The  final
CTDO pressure-series data are the data reported to the principal investiga-
tor and to the WHPO.

Subsequent sections of this document discuss the laboratory
calibrations, data processing and corrections for each CTD used during
JUNO1.


3.  CTD Laboratory Calibrations

3.1.  Pressure Transducer Calibration

Each CTD pressure transducer was calibrated in a temperature-
controlled bath to the ODF Ruska deadweight-tester (DWT) pressure
standards.  The mechanical hysteresis loading and unloading curves were
measured both pre- and post-cruise at cold temperature (-2.0 to -1.4
degrees C bath) to a maximum of 8830 psi, and at warm temperature (29.1 to
30.0 degrees C bath) to a maximum of 2030/4030 psi pre-/post-cruise.  The
CTD #1 post-cruise testing included an additional calibration to 4030 psi
in a 10.3 degrees C bath.

In addition to testing the CTD pressure response to increases in
pressure at stable temperatures (mechanical hysteresis), CTD pressure
sensor sensitivity to temperature change is checked by a thermal shock
test.  A CTD is subjected to a step change in temperature (usually from
warm air to cold water bath) at stable pressure in the laboratory, then the
CTD pressure and temperature are measured over a period of at least 1 hour.
The thermal shock response has been checked in the opposite direction, cold
bath to warm bath, for several CTDs.  The response is roughly a mirror-
image to the warm-to-cold response.  The thermal response of the CTD
pressure sensor is typically checked when the sensor is first installed,
then every few years.

Thermal shock tests for CTD #1 were done from warm air to cold water
bath, and later from cold bath to warm air, during the post-cruise
calibration.  Further testing was done in Oct.93 to get a better cold-to-
warm response check by going from cold bath to warm bath; the air was too
unstable to get a proper check in the May 93 attempt.  CTD #2 has not been
tested since 1987, when the current pressure sensor was first installed.

CTD #1 pre- and post-cruise pressure calibrations are summarized in
Figures 1 and 2; CTD #2 pressure calibrations are shown in figures 3 and 4.

3.2.  PRT Temperature Calibration

All CTD PRT temperature transducers were calibrated in a temperature-
controlled bath.  CTD temperatures were compared with temperatures
calculated from the resistance of a standard platinum resistance
thermometer (SPRT) as measured by a NBIS ATB-1250 resistance bridge.  The
ultimate temperature standards at ODF are water and diphenyl ether triple-
point cells and a gallium cell.  Six or more calibration temperatures,
spaced across the range of -2.0 to 30.1 degrees C, were measured both pre-
and post-cruise.

CTD pre- and post-cruise temperature calibrations, referenced to the
ITS-90 standard, are summarized in Figures 5 and 6.  Calibration
coefficients are then converted to the IPTS-68 standard: CTD temperature
data are corrected to the IPTS-68 standard because calculated parameters,
including salinity and density, are currently defined in terms of that
standard only.  After all data are finalized, IPTS-68 data are converted
back to the ITS-90 standard as desired via multiplication by a constant
factor.


4.  CTD Data Processing

4.1.  Pressure, Temperature and Conductivity/Salinity Corrections

A maximum of 36 salinity and oxygen check samples were collected
during each CTD cast.  Thermometric pressure and temperature data were also
measured at 1 or 2 levels for 99 casts during JUNO1.

A 3- to 4-second average of the CTD time-series data was calculated
for each sample.  The resulting data were then used to verify the pre- and
post-cruise temperature calibrations, and to derive CTD
conductivity/salinity and oxygen corrections.

There were numerous problems with dropouts/noise in all CTD channels
for the first 34 stations of JUNO1.  The problems continued despite
reterminating the wire several times, switching CTDs for 8 casts and
removing various combinations of sensors or peripheral instruments.  It was
finally determined that the noise/dropouts were winch-induced: the backup
winch was used from the second CTD cast for station 34 until the end of the
cruise, except for one cast at station 46 to test attempted repairs on the
primary winch.

The following chart clarifies which sensors/winches were used for each
cast:

4.1.1.  CTD Pressure Corrections

Please refer to Appendix A: "Improving the Measurement of Pressure in
the NBIS Mark III CTD" (Delahoyde/Williams) for details on the ODF pressure
model and its application.

4.1.1.1.  CTD #1

CTD #1 pre- and post-cruise pressure calibrations, Figures 1a and 1b,
were compared.  The warm/shallow and cold/deep calibration curves both
shifted at the surface by about 2.5 to 3 decibars from pre- to post-cruise.
The cold/deep pressure calibration curves had similar slopes in the top
2400 decibars, then diverged an additional 2 decibars between 2400 and 6100
decibars.  The post-cruise cold/upcast curve was 1 decibar closer to the
downcast than pre-cruise.  The warm/shallow slope was less steep post-
cruise, and the surface points were .5 decibar further from the cold curve
than they were during the pre-cruise calibration.  The post-cruise downcast
pressure calibrations had similar slopes at all 3 temperatures, whereas the
pre-cruise warm calibration curve was steeper than the cold.

Because of the pre- and post-cruise slope inconsistencies, laboratory
calibrations from Dec.91, May 92 and Oct.93 were also examined for trends
over time.  The cold/deep correction curve slopes have gone more more
negative and the warm/cold surface offsets have drifted apart with time.
Only the Aug.92/pre-cruise calibration contradicts these trends; the May
93/post-cruise pressure calibrations are much more consistent with the
history of the instrument.  The post-cruise pressure calibrations were used
to correct the CTD #1 station data, with an additional offset applied to
account for the shift in the calibration curves over time.  No slope change
was applied to the May 93 data, since there was less than a 1 decibar in
6000 decibars slope change between May 92 and May 93 laboratory
calibrations.

The additional offset to the pressure calibration was determined by
examining raw CTD pressure vs temperature data from the laboratory
temperature calibrations and comparable shipboard data.  Raw CTD pressure
vs temperature data from just before the CTD entered the water on each cast
were tabulated.  The CTD readings were fairly stable, with atmospheric
pressures and stable ambient temperatures around the CTD for 30 or more
minutes prior to each cast, similar to conditions during the laboratory
calibrations.  The post-cruise/May 93 pressure calibration curves were
shifted by the +2.5-decibar average difference between the laboratory and
cast data; the resulting data, Figure 1c, were used to correct JUNO1 CTD #1
pressure data.

Post-cruise warm-to-cold thermal shock data, Figure 2a, were fit to
determine the time constants and temperature coefficients which model the
pressure response to rapid temperature change.  May 91 and May 93/post-
cruise data were compared: the results were similar in magnitude and
response time.  A thermal shock test from cold to warm water baths was done
in Oct.93, Figure 2b.  The results were similar in magnitude but mirror-
image to the warm-to-cold shock tests from May 93.  The May 93 time
constants and temperature coefficients, listed in the table at the end of
this section, were used to correct the JUNO1 CTD #1 pressure data.  The
thermal response pressure correction applied to upcasts used a the downcast
correction, modified to achieve the mirror-image effect seen in the
laboratory.

Thermometric pressures were measured at 1 deep point on each of 99
casts.  The only shift observed in thermometric/CTD pressure differences
could be attributed to a change in the DSRTs used to measure the
thermometric values.

The shifted May 93/post-cruise calibration curve, Figure 1c, was used
in conjunction with the May 93 thermal shock results, Figure 2a, to correct
the pressure for all JUNO1 CTD #1 casts.  Any residual offset was
compensated for automatically at each station: as the CTD entered the
water, the corrected pressure was adjusted to 0.


4.1.1.2.  CTD #2

CTD #2 pre- and post-cruise pressure calibrations, Figures 3a and 3b,
were compared.  The warm/shallow calibration curves shifted by 3 decibars
from pre- to post-cruise; the cold/deep calibration curves shifted by 2
decibars in the same direction.  The slopes of the pressure calibration
curves shifted by less than half a decibar over 6000 decibars.  The CTD #2
shipboard pre-cast pressure vs. temperature data were only 1 decibar off
from the May 93 calibration data.  The shape of the upcast/shallow sections
of the May 93 calibration more closely resembled the shape of historical
CTD #2 calibration data.  The May 93 hysteresis curve, offset by 1 decibar
to match shipboard data, Figure 3c, was used to correct the CTD #2 pressure
data on JUNO1.

Warm-to-cold thermal shock data from Feb.87, Figure 4, were the only
available thermal shock data for the CTD #2 pressure sensor.  Time
constants and temperature coefficients were calculated from this data to
model the pressure response to rapid temperature change.  These values,
listed in the table at the end of this section, were used to correct the
JUNO1 CTD #2 pressure data.  As with CTD #1, the thermal response pressure
correction applied to upcasts used a modified version the downcast
correction to achieve the mirror-image effect seen in the laboratory for
other NBIS CTDs where cold-to-warm thermal shock data have been measured.

Thermometric pressure data were measured once per CTD #2 cast.  The
thermometric/CTD pressure differences were stable and comparable to the
values obtained for post-calibration CTD #1 data vs. the same DSRT.

The shifted May 93/post-cruise calibration curve, Figure 3c, was used
in conjunction with the Feb.87 thermal shock results, Figure 4, to correct
the pressure for the eight JUNO1 CTD #2 casts.  Any residual offset was
compensated for automatically at each station: as the CTD entered the
water, the corrected pressure was adjusted to 0.

4.1.2.  CTD Temperature Corrections

4.1.2.1.  CTD #1

CTD #1 had two temperature sensors: PRT-1, a Rosemount sensor, was
calibrated pre- and post-cruise; PRT-2 was an interchangeable FSI sensor.
Different FSI sensors were installed in CTD #1 during the pre- and post-
cruise calibrations; both FSI sensors underwent repairs between the
calibrations.

PRT-2 was used to check for PRT-1 drift during the cruise.  A .003
deg.C shift in the PRT-1/PRT-2 difference was noted during stations 6 and
7, the last two casts before switching PRT-2 sensors.  The differences
returned to normal after the backup FSI sensor was installed at station 16,
so PRT-1 appeared to be stable.  Both PRT-2 sensors failed during JUNO1 and
no PRT-2 was installed beginning station 29-3.  A thermometric temperature
was measured during each cast after station 30 to check for shifts in
PRT-1.  No shifts were noted during the leg.

A comparison of the pre- and post-cruise laboratory CTD #1 PRT-1
temperature transducer calibrations, Figures 5a and 5b, showed two curves
with nearly identical slopes and a +.001 deg.C shift in the temperature
correction over the range of 0 to 32 deg.C.  An average of the two
laboratory calibrations was calculated by averaging the coefficients of the
pre- and post-cruise temperature correction curve fits.  The corrections
were converted to the IPTS-68 standard and then applied to the CTD #1
temperature data.


4.1.2.2.  CTD #2

CTD #2 had two Rosemount temperature sensors, each calibrated pre- and
post-cruise (Figures 6a and 6b).  The correction for PRT-1, the primary
sensor, shifted an average +.007 deg.C between calibrations with no slope
change.  The correction for PRT-2, the secondary sensor, shifted an average
+.017 deg.C and had a steeper post-cruise slope.

PRT-1 and PRT-2 values during each JUNO1 CTD #2 cast were compared;
the differences between the two sensors remained constant at .004 deg.C.
Since all eight CTD #2 casts were done mid-Oct.92, only 2 months after the
pre-cruise calibration and 7 months before the May 93 calibration, and the
magnitude of the PRT-2 drift was more than twice the PRT-1 drift, it was
decided to use the pre-cruise PRT-1 temperature calibration data, Figure
6a.  The corrections were converted to the IPTS-68 standard and then
applied to the CTD #2 temperature data.

Thermometric temperature data were measured once per cast as another
way to validate CTD temperature data.  Thermometric/CTD temperature
differences for both CTDs, using the same DSRTs, were compared after
applying final CTD temperature corrections.  For casts where the DSRTs were
properly soaked, the differences were almost all less than .0005 deg.C,
indicating that CTD #2 temperature data are comparable to data from the
more stable CTD #1, whose calibration varied only .001 deg.C over 9 months.


4.1.3.  CTD Conductivity Corrections

In order to calibrate CTD conductivity, check-sample conductivities
were calculated from the bottle salinities using CTD pressures and
temperatures.  For each cast, the differences between sample and CTD
conductivities at all pressures were fit to CTD conductivity using a linear
least-squares fit.  Values greater than 2 standard deviations from the fits
were rejected.  The resulting conductivity correction slopes were plotted
as a function of station number.  The conductivity slopes were grouped by
stations, based on common PRT and conductivity sensor combinations, and
then fit as a function of station number to generate smoothed slopes for
each group.  These smoothed slopes were either averages of the slopes in
the station group (0-order) or changing by a fixed amount from station to
station (1st-order as a function of station number).

Conductivity differences were then calculated for each cast after
applying the preliminary conductivity slope corrections.  Residual
conductivity offsets were computed for each cast and fit to station number.
Smoothed offsets were determined by groups as above, based on common PRT
and conductivity sensor combinations.  The resulting smoothed offsets were
then applied to the data.  Conductivity slope as a function of conductivity
was re-checked to ensure that no residual slope remained.

Some offsets were manually adjusted to account for discontinuous
shifts in the conductivity transducer response, or to insure a consistent
deep T-S relationship from station to station.


4.1.3.1.  CTD #1

CTD #1 conductivity slopes were stable throughout JUNO1, dropping off
slightly in the last third of the cruise.  The calculated slopes for the
casts below 55 deg. S. latitude were much more scattered than the rest of
the leg.  This was where the surface conductivities shifted to being lower
than the deep conductivity values, plus the conductivity ranges within each
cast were only 2-4 mmho.  Because the slopes before and after these far-
south stations were consistent, it was decided to use the same (0-order)
slope for the higher-latitude stations as calculated for the lower-latitude
CTD #1 casts through station 84.  A gradually changing conductivity slope
as a function of station number was used for the last third of the casts,
shifting by less than -.0002 from station 85 to station 127.

Residual CTD #1 conductivity offset values were calculated after
applying the conductivity slopes.  There were no differences noted between
high and low latitude casts.  The conductivity offsets for the first 7
stations were fit as a function of station number, and the smoothed first-
order offsets were applied to stations 1 through 7.  This slow drift in
conductivity offsets is typical for the start of a leg, when the CTD has
not been used for over a week.  A constant conductivity offset value was
calculated and applied to the CTD #1 casts for stations 16 through 84.  A
slight upward drift in the offsets was noted from the stations in the
mid-80's to the end of the leg.  Conductivity offsets were fit as a
function of station number, then the smoothed first-order offsets were
applied to CTD conductivities for stations 85-127.  The transition in
offset values between station groups was smooth, with no sudden shifts
between groups.


4.1.3.2.  CTD #2

During JUNO1, CTD #2 was used for exactly 8 casts while CTD #1 was
under repair.  Conductivity sensors are usually left soaking in water
between casts to minimize drifting problems.  Prior to station 8, CTD #2
had not been used nor had its conductivity sensor been soaked since the CTD
left San Diego two months earlier.  CTD #2 conductivity drifted with time
during the first four casts (stations 8-11), where down and up casts were
noticeably shifting within each cast.  The drift decreased in magnitude the
more the CTD was used, becoming negligible by station 12.

CTD #2 conductivity slopes as a function of conductivity were
calculated using data above 1000 decibars only; the effect of the drifting
problems noted above was minimized by using this more limited range.  The
calculated slopes were consistent for all 8 casts, and an average of the
slopes was applied.

Residual conductivity offsets were then calculated for each CTD #2
cast for various pressure ranges.  It was decided to use the offset values
calculated from data below 4000 decibars only, again to minimize the effect
of the drifting noted above.  Individually calculated offsets were used for
stations 8-12; because the CTD drifting had stabilized after that point, an
average offset was used for stations 13-15.

The problem of drifting within each cast still needed to be resolved.
The apparent time- and/or pressure-dependent drift could be characterized
by a first-order slope with respect to pressure.  This would adequately
correct upcast CTD data, which could be directly matched up to bottle trip
data.  Upcasts were used for the final CTD #2 pressure-series data for
stations 8-13.  Stations 14 and 15 may have had small conductivity offsets
in the top 1000 decibars of their upcasts, so their downcast data were
used.

The time-based drift that caused large differences in down and up cast
data was apparently gone after station 12, but a small residual pressure
slope was still apparent on the rest of the CTD #2 casts, whether down or
up cast data were used.  Pressure-dependent slopes to conductivity were
calculated cast by cast from bottle vs CTD data, then applied to the eight
CTD #2 casts.  The sparse bottle data available for station 12 did not
distort its calculated pressure slope, which was consistent with the trend
in the 8-cast group.  The calculated slope for station 14 did not fit the
trend, so an average of the slopes from stations 13 and 15 was applied.


4.1.3.3.  Bottle vs. CTD Conductivity Statistical Summary

Plots  of the final/adjusted JUNO1 conductivity slopes and offsets for
both CTDs can be found in Figures 7a and 7b.  These plots  include  adjust-
ments made to the conductivity offsets to ensure continuity of cast-to-cast
TS relationships or to account for discontinuous shifts in  the  transducer
response.

The  JUNO1 calibrated bottle-minus-CTD conductivity statistics include
salinity values with quality 3 or 4.  There is approximately a  1:1  corre-
spondence between conductivity and salinity residual differences.  Plots of
the differences at all pressures and at pressures below 1500  decibars  are
shown in Figures 8a and 8b.

The following statistical results were generated from the final bottle
data set and the corrected up-cast CTD data:

4.2.  CTD Dissolved Oxygen Data

Please refer to Appendix B: "CTD Dissolved Oxygen Data Processing"
(Delahoyde) for details on ODF CTD oxygen processing.


4.2.1.  CTD Oxygen Corrections

Dissolved oxygen data were acquired using Sensormedics dissolved
oxygen sensors.  Two oxygen sensors were used during JUNO1.  Sensor A was
used with both CTDs for stations 1-15.  A new oxygen sensor B was put into
service starting with station 16 and was used until it died during station
60.  The original oxygen sensor A was put back on at station 61 and used
for the rest of the cruise.  Station 29 was done without an oxygen sensor
installed in an attempt to narrow down the source of the FSK noise problem
described earlier in this document.

CTD oxygen data were corrected after pressure, temperature and
conductivity corrections had been applied.  CTD raw oxygen currents were
extracted from the pressure-series data at isopycnals corresponding to the
up-cast check samples.  Most pressure-series data were from the down casts,
where oxygen data are usually smoother than up-cast data because of the
more constant lowering rate.  CTD oxygen data can be affected by flow-
dependence problems in either direction any time the cast is stopped or
slowed down, especially at bottle stops or bottom approaches.  Casts where
up-cast data were used are documented in Appendix D-1; cast stops longer
than 1 minute, which may have affected the pressure-series data, are noted
in Appendix D-2.

The CTD oxygen correction coefficients were determined by applying a
modified Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares fitting procedure to
residual differences between CTD and bottle oxygen values.  Bottle oxygen
values were weighted as required to optimize the fitting of CTD oxygen to
discrete bottle samples.  Some bottle levels were omitted from a fit
because of large pressure differences between down- and up-cast CTD data at
isopycnals.  Deep data points were often weighted more heavily than
shallower data due to the higher density of shallow sampling on a typical
36-bottle sampling scheme.

The JUNO1 surface oxygen data fitting was adversely affected by the
typical going-in-water bubbles/noise, making it difficult to fit CTD
oxygens to the bottle data in the surface mixed layer of many casts.  The
usefulness of CTD oxygen data above the second check sample should be
carefully considered.

There were tripping problems on several casts that resulted in large
sections of missing bottle data values.  Bottle data from nearby casts with
similar PTCO profiles were used to fill in these missing areas so a CTD
oxygen fit could be accomplished.  The affected casts for this cruise were
at stations 7, 12, 18 and 34-1.  Details regarding which bottle data were
used for these CTD oxygen fits are included in Appendix D-1.

Bottle oxygen data were recalculated with smoothed blanks and thio
normalities after CTD oxygen data were fit.

4.2.2.  Bottle vs. CTD Oxygen Statistical Summary

CTD oxygens were generated by fitting up cast oxygen bottle data to
down cast CTD raw oxygen current measurements along isopycnals.  Residual
oxygen differences of up cast bottle oxygens, with the new
blanks/normalities applied, vs corrected down cast CTD oxygens are shown in
the table below.  These differences include data values with quality code 3
or 4.

4.3.  Additional Processing

An excessive amount of FSK signal noise was noted during the first 34
JUNO1 CTD casts, plus station 46, before the problem was isolated as the
Alman Johnson winch.  The noise manifested itself as random bits dropping
out of the data stream, causing occasional dropouts/noise in any single
channel at various frames.  The pressure, temperature and conductivity
absolute and gradient filters, mentioned in the "CTD Acquisition and
Processing Summary" section near the beginning of this report, eliminated
most of the raw data frames with dropouts.  Raw oxygen data are usually not
filtered, but it was necessary to add an oxygen filter and re-block-
average/re-process 15 JUNO1 casts with excessive oxygen dropouts: stations
4-7, 12, 14, 15, 25-28, 30, 32, 34-1 and 46.  Some small-scale noise,
especially in the oxygen signal, may still remain in any cast done with the
Alman Johnson winch.  The transmissometer signal on the Alman Johnson casts
was not filtered; those data are very noisy in comparison to casts done
with the Markey winch.

A post-block-averaging software filter was used on 67 casts to remove
conductivity or temperature spiking problems in about 0.055% of the time-
series data frames.  Pressure did not require filtering.

Post-block-averaging oxygen spikes were filtered out of 116 casts.
The filtered oxygen levels affected approximately .287% of the time-series
data frames.  96.0% of the filtered oxygen data were shallower than 100
decibars and could be directly related to bubbles trapped during the going-
in-water transition.

Remaining density inversions in high-gradient regions cannot be
accounted for by a mis-match of pressure, temperature and conductivity
sensor response.  Detailed examination of the raw data showed significant
mixing occurring in these areas because of ship roll.  The ship-roll filter
resulted in a reduction in the amount and size of density inversions.

After filtering, the down cast (or up cast - see table below) portion
of each time-series was pressure-sequenced into 2-decibar pressure
intervals.  A ship-roll filter was applied to each cast during pressure
sequencing to disallow pressure reversals.

5.  General Comments/Problems

There is one pressure-sequenced CTD data set, to near the ocean floor,
for each of 128 casts at 127 stations.  Additional test casts were neither
processed nor reported.

The data reported is from down casts, excepting the 10 casts listed
below:

The 0-decibar level of some casts was extrapolated using a quadratic
fit through the next three deeper levels.  Recorded surface values were
rejected only when it appeared that the drift was caused by sensors
adjusting to the in-water transition; if there was any question that the
surface values might be real, the original data were reported.
Extrapolated surface levels are identified by a count of "1" in the "Number
of Raw Frames in Average" reported with each data record; they are also
noted in Appendix D-1.

One time-series data set, station 46, had a few seconds of missing
data in several spots due to the FSK signal noise problems mentioned
earlier.  Data missing in the corresponding 2-decibar pressure-series
levels were interpolated.  The pressures for these interpolated data
frames, as well as other cast-by-cast shipboard or processing comments, are
listed in the "CTD Shipboard and Processing Comments" in Appendix D-1.  All
interpolated data levels also have a count of "1" in the "Number of Raw
Frames in Average" column in the data files.

In addition, missing data values, such as CTD oxygens in casts where
the sensor failed or was not present on the rosette package, are
represented as "-9" in the data files.  There are two such casts in this
data set:  029/03 and 060/01.  Stations without transmissometer data will
have "0" in the transmissometer data field.  In this data set, stations
16-24, 27-37, and 88-95 are without transmissometer data.  The
transmissometer was malfunctioning during stations 7 and 8, so those data
should be ignored.

The CTD oxygen sensor often requires several seconds in the water
before being wet enough to respond properly; this is manifested as low or
high CTD oxygen values at the start of some casts.  Flow-dependence
problems occur when the lowering rate varies, or when the CTD is stopped
and/or slowed, as during bottom approaches, at the cast bottom, or at
bottle trips, where depletion of oxygen at the sensor causes lower oxygen
readings.  Significant delays or yoyos during the casts are also documented
in Appendix D.

D. DESCRIPTION OF HYDROGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES AND CALIBRATIONS
   (Oceanographic Data Facility)
   2 July 2001


D.1.  Water Sampling Package

ODF CTD/rosette casts were carried out with a 36 bottle rosette sampler of
ODF manufacture using General Oceanics pylons.  An ODF-modified NBIS Mark 3
CTD, a Benthos altimeter, a SensorMedics oxygen sensor and a SeaTech
transmissometer provided by Texas A&M University (TAMU) were mounted on the
rosette frame.  Seawater samples were collected in 10-liter PVC Niskin and
ODF bottles mounted on the rosette frame.  A Benthos pinger was mounted
separately on the rosette frame; its signal was displayed on the precision
depth recorder (PDR) in the ship's laboratory.  The rosette/CTD was
suspended from a three-conductor EM cable which provided power to the CTD
and relayed the CTD signal to the laboratory.

Each CTD cast extended to within approximately 10 meters of the bottom
unless the bottom returns from both the pinger and the altimeter were
extremely poor.  The bottles were numbered 1 through 36.  When one of these
36 bottles needed servicing and repairs could not be accomplished by the
next cast, the replacement bottle was given a new number.  The replacement
bottles were numberd 38 and 41.  Subsets of CTD data taken at the time of
water sample collection were transmitted to the bottle data files
immediately after each cast to provide pressure and temperature at the
sampling depth, and to facilitate the examination and quality control of
the bottle data as the laboratory analyses were completed.  The CTD data
and documentation are submitted separately.

Large Volume Sampling (LVS)  [Key91] was also performed on this expedition.
These casts were carried out with ~270-liter stainless steel Gerard barrels
on which were mounted 5-liter bottles with deep-sea reversing thermometers
(DSRTs).  Samples for salinity, silicate and 14C were obtained from the
Gerard barrels; samples for salinity and silicate were drawn from piggyback
Niskin-style bottles.  The salinity and silicate samples from each
piggyback bottle were used for comparison with the Gerard barrel salinity
and silicate to verify the integrity of the Gerard sample.


D.2.  Bottle Sampling

At the end of each rosette deployment water samples were drawn from the
bottles in the following order:

     CFCs;
     3He;
     O2;
     Total CO2;
     Alkalinity;
     AMS 14C;
     Tritium;
     Nutrients;
     Salinity.

Tritium, Nutrients (silicate, phosphate, nitrate and nitrite), and Salinity
could be sampled in arbitrary order.
The identifiers of the sample containers and the numbers of the ODF or
Niskin samplers from which the samples were drawn were recorded on the
Sample Log sheet.  Normal ODF sampling practice is to open the drain valve
before opening the air vent to see if water escapes, indicating the
presence of a small air leak in the sampler.  This observation ("air
leak"), and other comments ("lanyard caught in lid", "valve left open",
etc.) which may indicate some doubt about the integrity of the water
samples were also noted on the Sample Log sheets.  These comments are
included in this documentation with investigative comments and results.

Tripping problems were experienced at the beginning of the leg until all
the lanyards were fine-tuned.  There were also numerous tripping problems
occurring with 24-place pylons toward the end of the leg (from about
Station 100 on).  Most were "double trips", with one bottle not closing at
the intended level but then closing at the next level up, along with the
bottle intended to trip at that level.  Some of these actually sometimes
tripped up 1 further level, ending up with 3 bottles tripping at the same
depth.  CTD data was used for the scheduled levels that had been missed.
Attempts were repeatedly made to find a solution to the problems by
swapping out the 2 24-place pylons.  At one point some bent release pins
were straightened but most of the effort was in seeking the exactly correct
alignment position for each pin.

Samples for salinity, silicate and 14C were obtained from the Gerard
barrels; samples for salinity and silicate were drawn from the piggyback
Niskin bottles.  The Gerard barrels were numbered 81 through 94 and the
piggyback bottles were numbered 41 through 50 and 71.  The salinity and
silicate samples from the piggyback bottle were used for comparison with
the Gerard barrel salinities and silicates to verify the integrity of the
Gerard sample.

LVS casts experienced an annoying number of pre-trips.  A rogue wave hit
the aft part of the deck and wiped out the aft hanger door as well as
banging the bottom parts of the barrels into each other.  There did not
seem to be any permanent damage to the barrels after repairs were made.

D.3.  Bottle Data Processing

The discrete hydrographic data were entered into the shipboard data system
and processed as the analyses were completed.  The bottle data were brought
to a usable, though not final, state at sea.  ODF data checking procedures
included verification that the sample was assigned to the correct depth.
This was accomplished by checking the raw data sheets, which included the
raw data value and the water sample bottle, versus the sample log sheets.
The oxygen and nutrient data were compared by ODF with those from adjacent
stations.  Any comments regarding the water samples were investigated.  The
raw data computer files were also checked for entry errors that could have
been made on the station number, bottle number and/or flask number (as
would be the case for oxygens).  The salinity and oxygen values were
transmitted from PC's attached to either the salinometer or oxygen
titration system.  Nutrients were manually entered into the computer;
therefore these values were double checked for data entry errors.

Investigation of data included comparison of bottle salinity and oxygen
with CTD data, and review of data plots of the station profile alone and
compared to nearby stations.  Salinity, oxygen, and the nutrients were
compared to P6 and TUNES 2 and agreed within WOCE standards.  If a data
value did not either agree satisfactorily with the CTD or with other nearby
data, then analysis and sampling notes, plots, and nearby data were
reviewed.  If any problem was indicated, the data value was flagged.

WHP water bottle quality codes were assigned as defined in the WOCE
Operations Manual [Joyc94] with the following additional interpretations:
  
   2 | No problems noted.
   3 | Leaking.  An air leak large enough to produce an
     | observable effect on a sample is identified by a code of
     | 3 on the bottle and a code of 4 on the oxygen.  (Small
     | air leaks may have no observable effect, or may only
     | affect gas samples.)
   4 | Did not trip correctly.  Bottles tripped at other than
     | the intended depth were assigned a code of 4.  There may
     | be no problems with the associated water sample data.
   5 | Not reported.  No water sample data reported.  This is a
     | representative level derived from the CTD data for
     | reporting purposes.  The sample number should be in the
     | range of 80-99.
   8 | Pair did not trip correctly. Note that the Niskin bottle
     | can trip at an unplanned depth while the Gerard trips
     | correctly and vice versa.
   9 | The samples were not drawn from this bottle.


WHP water sample quality flags were assigned using the following criteria:
   
   1 | The sample for this measurement was drawn from the water
     | bottle, but the results of the analysis were not (yet)
     | received.
   2 | Acceptable measurement.
   3 | Questionable measurement.  The data did not fit the
     | station profile or adjacent station comparisons (or
     | possibly CTD data comparisons).  No notes from the
     | analyst indicated a problem.  The data could be
     | acceptable, but are open to interpretation.
   4 | Bad measurement.  The data did not fit the station
     | profile, adjacent stations or CTD data.  There were
     | analytical notes indicating a problem, but data values
     | were reported.  Sampling and analytical errors were also
     | coded as 4.
   5 | Not reported.  There should always be a reason
     | associated with a code of 5, usually that the sample was
     | lost, contaminated or rendered unusable.
   9 | The sample for this measurement was not drawn.


WHP water sample quality flags were assigned to the CTDSAL (CTD salinity)
parameter as follows:
  
   2 | Acceptable measurement.
   3 | Questionable measurement.  The data did not fit the
     | bottle data, or there was a CTD conductivity calibration
     | shift during the up-cast.
   4 | Bad measurement.  The CTD up-cast data were determined
     | to be unusable for calculating a salinity.
   7 | Despiked.  The CTD data have been filtered to eliminate
     | a spike or offset.


WHP water sample quality flags were assigned to the CTDOXY (CTD O2)
parameter as follows:

   1 | Not calibrated.  Data are uncalibrated.
   2 | Acceptable measurement.
   3 | Questionable measurement.
   4 | Bad measurement.  The CTD data were determined to be
     | unusable for calculating a dissolved oxygen
     | concentration.
   5 | Not reported.  The CTD data could not be reported,
     | typically when CTD salinity is coded 3 or 4.
   7 | Despiked.  The CTD data have been filtered to eliminate
     | a spike or offset.
   9 | Not sampled.  No operational CTD O2 sensor was present
     | on this cast.


Note that CTDOXY values were derived from the down-cast pressure-series CTD
data.  CTD data were matched to the up-cast bottle data along isopycnal
surfaces.  If the CTD salinity is footnoted as bad or questionable, the CTD
O2 is not reported.

All pressures and temperatures for the bottle data tabulations on the
rosette casts were obtained by averaging CTD data for a brief interval at
the time the bottle was closed on the rosette, then correcting the data
based on CTD laboratory calibrations.

All reported CTD data are calibrated and processed with the methodology
described in the documentation accompanying the CTD data submission.

LVS pressures and temperatures were calculated from deep-sea reversing
thermometer (DSRT) readings.  Each DSRT rack normally held 2 protected
(temperature) thermometers and 1 unprotected (pressure) thermometer.
Thermometers were read by two people, each attempting to read a precision
equal to one tenth of the thermometer etching interval.  Thus, a
thermometer etched at 0.05 degree intervals would be read to the nearest
0.005 degrees.

Each temperature value reported on the LVS casts is calculated from the
average of four readings provided both protected thermometers function
normally.  The pressure is verified by comparison with the calculation of
pressure determined by wireout.  The pressure from the thermometer is
fitted by a polynomial equation which incorporates the wireout and wire
angle.

Calibration of the thermometers are performed in ODF's calibration facility
depending on the age of the thermometer and not more than two years of the
expedition.

The temperatures are based on the International Temperature Scale of 1990.


D.3.2.  Salinity Analysis

Equipment and Techniques

A single ODF-modified Guildline Autosal Model 8400A salinometer (Serial
Number 57-396), located in a temperature-controlled laboratory, was used to
measure salinities.  The salinometers were modified by ODF and contained
interfaces for computer-aided measurement.

Salinity samples were analyzed for the rosette casts and the Large Volume
casts from both the piggyback bottle and the Gerard barrel.

The salinity analyses were performed when samples had equilibrated to
laboratory temperature, within 8-25 hours after collection.  The
salinometer was standardized for each group of analyses (typically one
cast, usually 36 samples) using at least one fresh vial of standard
seawater per group.  A computer (PC) prompted the analyst for control
functions such as changing sample, flushing, or switching to "read" mode.
At the correct time, the computer acquired conductivity ratio measurements,
and logged results.  The sample conductivity was redetermined until
readings met software criteria for consistency.  Measurements were then
averaged for a final result.

Sampling and Data Processing

Salinity samples were drawn into 200 ml Kimax high-alumina borosilicate
bottles, which were rinsed three times with sample prior to filling.  The
bottles were sealed with custom-made plastic insert thimbles and Nalgene
screw caps.  This assembly provides very low container dissolution and
sample evaporation.  Prior to collecting each sample, inserts were
inspected for proper fit and loose inserts were replaced to insure an
airtight seal.  The draw time and equilibration time were logged for all
casts.  Laboratory temperatures were logged at the beginning and end of
each run.

PSS-78 salinity [UNES81] was calculated for each sample from the measured
conductivity ratios.  The difference (if any) between the initial vial of
standard water and one run at the end as an unknown was applied linearly to
the data to account for any drift.  The data were added to the cruise
database.

Salinity samples were compared with CTD data and significant differences
were investigated.

The estimated accuracy of bottle salinities run at sea is usually better
than 0.002 PSU relative to the particular standard seawater batch used.
Although laboratory precision of the Autosal can be as small as 0.0002 psu
when running replicate samples under ideal conditions, at sea the expected
precision is about 0.001 psu under normal conditions, with a stable lab
temperature.

Laboratory Temperature

There were some problems with lab temperature control throughout cruise;
the Autosal bath temperature was adjusted accordingly.  Salinities were
generally considered good for the expedition despite the lab temperature
problem.

Standards

IAPSO Standard Seawater (SSW) Batch P-120 was used to standardize the
salinometers.


D.3.3.  Oxygen Analysis

Equipment and Techniques

Dissolved oxygen analyses were performed with an ODF-designed automated
oxygen titrator using photometric end-point detection based on the
absorption of 365nm wavelength ultra-violet light.
The titration of the samples and the data logging were controlled by PC
software.  Thiosulfate was dispensed by a Dosimat 665 buret driver fitted
with a 1.0 ml buret.  ODF uses a whole-bottle Winkler titration following
the technique of Carpenter [Carp65] with modifications by Culberson et al.
[Culb91], but with higher concentrations of potassium iodate standard
(approximately 0.012N) and thiosulfate solution (50 gm/l).  Standard
solutions prepared from pre-weighed potassium iodate crystals were run at
the beginning of each session of analyses, which typically included from 1
to 3 stations.  Several standards were made up during the cruise and
compared to assure that the results were reproducible, and to preclude the
possibility of a weighing or dilution error.  Reagent/distilled water
blanks were determined, to account for presence of oxidizing or reducing
materials.  The auto-titrator generally performed very well.  A decrease in
voltage output led to changing the UV source lamp during the cruise.

Sampling and Data Processing

Samples were collected for dissolved oxygen analyses soon after the rosette
sampler was brought on board, and after samples for CFC and helium were
drawn.  Using a Tygon drawing tube, nominal 125ml volume-calibrated iodine
flasks were rinsed twice with minimal agitation, then filled and allowed to
overflow for at least 3 flask volumes.  The sample draw temperature was
measured with a small platinum resistance thermometer embedded in the
drawing tube.  Reagents were added to fix the oxygen before stoppering.
The flasks were shaken twice to assure thorough dispersion of the
precipitate, once immediately after drawing, and then again after about 20
minutes.  The samples were usually analyzed within a few hours of
collection and and then the data were merged into the cruise database.

Thiosulfate normalities were calculated from each standardization and
corrected to 20 deg.C.  The 20 deg.C normalities and the blanks were
plotted versus time and were reviewed for possible problems.  New
thiosulfate normalities were recalculated after the blanks had been
smoothed as a function of time, if warranted.  These normalities were then
smoothed, and the oxygen data were recalculated.

Oxygens were converted from milliliters per liter to micromoles per
kilogram using the in situ temperature.  Ideally, for whole-bottle
titrations, the conversion temperature should be the temperature of the
water issuing from the bottle spigot.  The sample temperatures were
measured at the time the samples were drawn from the bottle, but were not
used in the conversion from milliliters per liter to micromoles per
kilogram because the software for this calculation was not available.
Aberrant drawing temperatures provided an additional flag indicating that a
bottle may not have tripped properly.  The electronic thermometer for
measuring draw temperatures ceased to function part-way through the cruise
and a mercury thermometer was used for a couple of days until ODF's
Electronic Technician made up a new electronic one.

Even though laboratory and sample temperatures were recorded, these
temperatures were not used in the calculation of oxygen.  Therefore, these
temperatures are not reported in the data submission to ensure that the
data user does not use these temperatures.  Measured sample temperatures
from mid-deep water samples were about 4-7 deg.C warmer than in-situ
temperature.  Had the conversion with the measured sample temperature been
made, converted oxygen values, would be about 0.08% higher for a 6 deg.C
warming (or about 0.2umol/kg for a 250umol/kg sample).

Volumetric Calibration

Oxygen flask volumes were determined gravimetrically with degassed
deionized water to determine flask volumes at ODF's chemistry laboratory.
This is done once before using flasks for the first time and periodically
thereafter when a suspect bottle volume is detected.  The volumetric flasks
used in preparing standards were volume-calibrated by the same method, as
was the 10 ml Dosimat buret used to dispense standard iodate solution.

Standards

Potassium iodate standards, nominally 0.44 gram, were pre-weighed in ODF's
chemistry laboratory to +/-0.0001 grams.  The exact normality was
calculated at sea after the volumetric flask volume and dilution
temperature were known.

Potassium iodate was obtained from Johnson Matthey Chemical Co.  and was
reported by the supplier to be >99.4% pure.  All other reagents were
"reagent grade" and were tested for levels of oxidizing and reducing
impurities prior to use.


D.4.  Nutrients

Nutrient analyses (phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite) were performed
on an ODF-modified 4-channel Technicon AutoAnalyzer II, generally within a
few hours after sample collection.
Occasionally samples were refrigerated up to a maximum of 8 hours at 2-6
deg.C.  All samples were brought to room temperature prior to analysis.
The methods used are described by Gordon et al. [Gord92].

Silicate was analyzed using the technique of Armstrong et al. [Arms67].  An
acidic solution of ammonium molybdate was added to a seawater sample to
produce silicomolybdic acid which was then reduced to silicomolybdous acid
(a blue compound) following the addition of stannous chloride.  The sample
was passed through a 15mm flowcell and measured at 820nm.  This response is
known to be non-linear at high silicate concentrations; this non-linearity
is included in ODF's software.

A modification of the Armstrong et al. [Arms67] procedure was used for the
analysis of nitrate and nitrite.  For the nitrate analysis, the seawater
sample was passed through a cadmium reduction column where nitrate was
quantitatively reduced to nitrite.  This nitrite is then diazotized with
sulfanilamide and coupled with N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine to form an
azo dye.  The sample is then passed through a 15mm flowcell and measured at
540nm.  A 50mm flowcell is required for nitrite (NO2).  The procedure is
the same for the nitrite analysis less the cadmium column.

Phosphate was analyzed using a modification of the Bernhardt and Wilhelms
[Bern67] technique.  An acidic solution of ammonium molybdate was added to
the sample to produce phosphomolybdic acid, then reduced to
phosphomolybdous acid (a blue compound) following the addition of
dihydrazine sulfate.  The reaction product was heated to ~55 deg.C to
enhance color development, then passed through a 50mm flowcell and the
absorbance measured at 820m.

Besides running rosette cast samples, LVS cast samples for both Gerard
barrels and piggyback Niskins were analyzed for silicate as an added check
(with salinity) on barrel sample integrity.

Nutrient samples were drawn into 45 ml high density polypropylene, narrow
mouth, screw-capped centrifuge tubes which were rinsed three times before
filling.  Standardizations were performed at the beginning and end of each
group of analyses (one cast, usually 36 samples) with a set of an
intermediate concentration standard prepared for each run from secondary
standards.  These secondary standards were in turn prepared aboard ship by
dilution from dry, pre-weighed standards.  Sets of 4-6 different
concentrations of shipboard standards were analyzed periodically to
determine the deviation from linearity as a function of concentration for
each nutrient.

All peaks were logged manually, and all the runs were re-read to check for
possible reading errors.

Temperature regulation problems in the analytical lab did not appear to
significantly affect the results, which were generally very good.  ODF
first attempted to control the temperature in the lab during the previous
leg by rigging up a ceramic heater and fan, under the control of a
thermistor and in conjunction with the ship's cooling.  This worked well on
this leg, providing about plus or minus 0.5 deg.C stability, except when
outside temperatures were too warm in the tropics, or when it became too
cold and the ship's heating system was erratically controlled.  Depending
on the ship's heading, the wind would sometimes blow directly into either
the lab's ventilation shaft or the vent for the hood.  In these extreme
cold conditions, the vent covers (up on the exterior 02 level) were closed
by the analysts after first checking with the ship's engineering staff.

Nutrients, reported in micromoles per kilogram, were converted from
micromoles per liter by dividing by sample density calculated at 1 atm
pressure (0 db), in situ salinity, and an assumed laboratory temperature of
25 deg.C.

Standard

Silicate standard is obtained from Fischer Scientific and is reported by
the supplier to be >98% pure.  Nitrate, nitrite and phosphate standards are
obtained from Johnson Matthey Chemical Co. and the supplier reports a
purity of 99.999%, 97%, and 99.999%, respectively.

DQ EVALUATION OF JUNOI (KNORR CR. 138/9) P16A/P17A HYDROGRAPHIC DATA
(A. Mantyla)
8 Aug. 96


In spite of the many rosette trip problems that resulted in numerous
unfortunate data gaps the quality of the data is, for the most part,
quite good.  The use of a 36 place rosette made the loss of data
less serious than it would have been if only a 24 place rosette had
been used.  Only 4 stations (7,12,19, and 110) out of 127 occupied
were major "busts" for water sampling, but each did have complete
full depth CTD data available.  The data originators have done a 
thorough job in evaluating the data, and in resolving inadvertent 
shifts in rosette bottle tripping sequences that result from 
mis-fires, hang-ups, or double-trips.  In some cases the data
originators flagged bottle codes "4" to indicate that the bottle
did not trip where planned, although all of the water sample data
is okay and confirmed by CTD salinity and oxygen comparisons.  For
the most part, I have changed those codes to "2" because the data 
really is okay, even though the CTD operator did not initially know
which bottle they were tripping.  Because many data users automatically
throw out any data flagged 3 or 4, it would be a shame to have data
not used that is really okay.  Stations 10 and 56 are good examples.  
I have left the "4" code at double trip levels on the extraneous trips
(where bottle 13 tripped with bottle 36, adjacent rosette slots, for
example).

I feel that they were a little over-zealous in the use of the "sample
is bad" code.  There are clear cases of leakers that are clearly wrong
and should be flagged bad.  But in other cases where data is only 
slightly questionable, I have changed the code from "bad" to "uncertain",
or even to okay when the apparent error is within WOCE precision 
tolerances.

The CTD data processors noted that the CTD O2 data assigned to the bottle 
trips are actually from the down profile (taken at the same density level
as the bottle data) and are often poor near the surface.  I agree, and have
flagged obvious cases as questionable data.  

The numerous double-trips in the latter part of the cruise have been 
properly resolved, but the CTD data at the missed levels have not been 
saved.  In a discrete data set archive that is usually used separate from
high resolution CTD data sets, it would be valuable to leave in the trip
information for better vertical resolution of at least the T and S (and
the density) profile.  I recommend the delete data gaps be restored with
the corrected CTDO2 trip information.

I have not made detailed comparisons of this cruise with crossings of 
other cruises because I understand that is being done in a rigorous fashion
by someone else.  However, there doesn't appear to be any serious discrepancies
between the duplicated stations occupied by both JUNO and TUNES, aside
from surprisingly large seasonal differences in the surface waters.

On station 35, bottle 13 listed at 695db is bad there, but would be okay 
listed at the bottom with the CTD data from bottle 36, as done on several 
stations later in the cruise.  I suggest that be done, changing the
bottle code from 3 to 4 and the "4" sample codes to "2"; and leave the
CTD information at 695db with a fake bottle number.

On station 73, there appears to be oxygen sample drawing problems, although
not as severe as indicated by the originators "bad" codes between 
1006 and 2216db.  Comparisons of oxygen versus density plots of this and
the bracketing stations indicate that most of the oxygens are okay, and
only the ones from 1209db (probably drawn from 1307db) and 2216db (probably
drawn from 2065db) are questionable.  I have changed the quality flags 
accordingly and would recommend the CTDO2 fit be redone.

In spite of the problems arising from trip uncertainties, the analytical
results (salinity, oxygen, and especially the nutrients) were as good as
any that I've seen.  It was unfortunate that the ship scheduling pushed 
the cruise into the wrong season, making it impossible to get closer 
to Antarctica.




DATA QUALITY EVALUATION REPORT FOR CTD DATA: WOCE LEGS P16A AND P17A
(Bob Millard)
December 11, 1996


WOCE hydrographic sections P16A and P17A, collected south of Tahiti along 150W 
and 135W to the Antarctic ice, are examined in this report. The overall 
potential temperature versus salinity plot of figure 1 shows the range of 
potential temperature variation from below -1.5 to 26 C while the salinity 
varies from 33.75 to 36.3 psu. The oxygens values range from 155 to 330 
µmol/kg, as the potential temperature versus oxygen plots of figure 2 
indicates. All of the 2 decibar CTD temperature, salinity and oxygen 
observations and those water sample data marked as good in the bottle file are 
displayed in figures 1 and 2. As a more detailed examination of the CTD data 
shows, these data are very well calibrated to the water samples and in general 
free of spurious observations. The only apparent oddity seen in these overall 
plots is the high surface oxygen of station 65 which is examined later.

The cruise report contains good descriptions of the instrument calibration 
methods in the laboratory and at sea as well as the general CTD data processing 
methods along with adaptions made for this data set to obtain the 2 decibar CTD 
profiles. These descriptions closely follow write-ups for other Scripps cruise 
reports. The laboratory pressure calibration description gives some standards 
pressure values in psi while the CTD measurements are reported in decibars. I 
would keep all pressures in units of decibars. I was confused by the method use 
to correct the station varying CTD conductivity calibrations. It is described 
as first applying a station dependent slope adjust (in some cases) and then 
following with a station dependent conductivity bias Ue. stations 85-127). 1 
agree with correcting the conductivity drift from station to station by varying 
the conductivity slope as this models the conductivity cell dimensions 
changing. It seems redundant to then further adjusted in some cases (like 
stations 85-127) with a station by station conductivity bias in the deep water. 
Does this imply that a slight vertical calibration error remains after the best 
fit conductivity slope was applied which is corrected by the conductivity bias 
adjustment? The resultant CTD salinities appear well well behaved in the 
vertical as discussed next.

A check of the CTD salinity calibrations for up-profile bottle file samples is 
given in figure 3 a, b, and c. Figure 3a shows salinities differences (all 
differences are CTD-Water Sample value CWSI) for those WS data marked good in 
the quality word for all pressure levels. Only a few values in stations 54, 61, 
64, 121 appear to be excessively large. Further checking shows all of these 
occur in high salt gradient regions where large differences can occur. Figure 
3b shows the good salinities differences below 1000 decibars with the station 
average (solid line) close to the zero line. The standard deviation for all the 
good deep water salinity differences below 1000 dbars is low (0.001 psu). The 
station average line plotted on figure 3b suggested that only a few stations 
(28, 55, and 92) might have deep salinity calibration problems. These stations 
are looked at more closely using offset (waterfall) plots of salinity 
difference versus pressure and also potential temperature versus salinity 
plots. Figure 3c is a plot of salinity differences versus pressure which 
indicates that the CTD salinity data for these WOCE legs are very well 
calibrated in the vertical.

Waterfall plots of salinity differences versus pressure offset and labelled 
with station numbers are shown in figure 4a, b, & c, for stations groups around 
the stations 28, 55, and 92 questioned earlier. These plots reinforce the 
possibility of a salinity calibration error in the CTD but difference plots 
can't sort out whether the CTD or bottle salinity is in error. Figure 5 plots 
potential temperature versus salinity for stations around 28 and it appears 
that the CTD salinity is salty. The same Theta/S plot (figure 6) for stations 
around 55 clearly shows that most bottle salts of station 55 are fresh below 1 
C and finally the theta/S for stations around 92 (figure 7) indicates that the 
CTD salts are high.

Overall and deep water (pressures greater than 2000 dbars) histograms of 
salinity and oxygen differences (CTD-WS) are given in figure 8. The salinity 
differences below 2000 dbars have an extremely good standard deviation (0.001 
psu) and mean difference indicating careful bottle salinity quality control and 
CTD calibration. The oxygen differences below 2000 dbars also show a low 
standard deviation of 0.78 µmol/kg and mean difference of zero again indicates 
careful bottle oxygen quality control and CTD calibration.

A comparison of the station to station CTD oxygen calibrations to the bottle 
oxygens (CTD-WS µmol/kg) is shown in figures 9a and b. Oxygen differences at 
depths greater than 1000 decibars are extremely tight around the zero line with 
no stations standing out except for one observation level of station 34. The 
vertical calibration of the CTD oxygens appears well behaved as indicated in 
figure 9c. There is one large difference at about 4500 decibars which also 
belongs to station 34. A theta/oxygen plot (figure 10) of stations 32 to 37 
shows the CTD down and up (o) deep oxygens (theta less than .8 C) to be high. 
Figure 11 shows the oxygen differences for these same stations plotted versus 
pressure with the CTD oxygen drifting progressively higher below 4100 decibars. 
The 2 decibar CTD data should to be flagged questionable below 4100 dbars for 
station 34. Station 34's 2 dbar oxygens appear noisy in the deep water compared 
to neighboring stations. This seems to be confirmed in the high-pass filtered 
noisy summary shown in figure 12.


NOISE CHECKS FOR SPURIOUS SALINITY AND OXYGEN VALUES:

An evaluation of the CTD salinity and oxygen noise levels with checks for 
spurious data values. To check for spurious salinity and oxygen observations in 
the 2 decibar CTD data the standard deviation of the high-pass filtered oxygen 
and salinity with wavelengths between 4 and 25 decibars is summarized in the 
deep water depth ranges to the cast bottom. The standard deviation (scatter) is 
plotted versus station for several depth intervals from the bottom to the 
surface. Figure 12a, & b shows the standard deviation of salinity (12a) and 
oxygen (12b) from 3000 dbars to the bottom of the cast. The station bottom 
pressure is shown in figure 12c. Note some station don't go to 3000 dbars and 
the are left blank on plot 12 a & b. The average salinity scatter (0.00023 psu) 
is indicated on the plot and includes stations with higher levels of scatter 
(see stations 21, 36, and 84-90). Upon further examination these anomalies were 
found to be real; associated with salinity finestructure in the deep waters as 
shown in figure 13. The salinity noise level (minimum, scatter) is 
approximately 0.0002 psu (see stations in 30's, upper 50's and 130's). 
Excessive oxygen noise in figure 12b is seen for stations 25-27, 34, and 53 
which appears to be instrumental. Station 34 was observed earlier (figure 11) 
to exhibit some added oxygen noise over neighboring stations. Figure 14 shows a 
plot of oxygens versus pressure for stations 24 to 27. Bursts of oxygen noise 
are observed to always be towards lower oxygen for stations 25-27. This might 
be lowering rate induced (a slower lowering rate equals lower oxygen values) as 
the oxygen sensor is flow rate sensitive. The station 53 oxygen profile also 
shows oxygen spikes towards lower values as can be seen in figure 15. The 
average oxygen standard deviation is 0.22 µmol/kg which is close to the 
observed oxygen noise level (minimum) of slightly less than 0.2 µmol/kg. The 
observed CTD noise levels from other data sets examined have ranged in salinity 
from 0.0001 to 0.0003 psu and in oxygen from 0.08 µmol/kg to 0.35 µmol/kg. Both 
the salinity and oxygen deep water standard deviations for P16A and 17A are at 
the lower end of these previously observed noise values ranges.

The extremes values of the high-passed filtered salinities oxygens are shown in 
figures 16a & c with the pressure level that they occur shown in figure 16b. 
Only one extreme value was found to be a data problem, the low (.12 psu) 
surface salinity of station 10, as can be seen in figure 17. The high surface 
oxygen values of station 65 noted in figure 2 are plotted versus pressure in 
figure 18 together with neighboring stations. Station 65 is 20 µmol/kg higher 
than both the surface water sample oxygen and neighboring oxygens suggesting 
that the 2 dbar CTD oxygens from 0 to 40 dbars should be flagged as 
questionable.


VERTICAL STABILITY CHECKS:

A check for density inversions provides additional information about spurious 
salinity and/or temperature values particularly in the near surface region 
where this method provides a more sensitive test than looking at the high wave 
number salinity variability. The vertical gradient of potential density 
(determined by computing the first difference of density) is calculated and 
checked for decreases in density with depth exceeding one of two thresholds: (-
0.005 and -0.0075 kg/m3). The P16A/17A CTD data has very few questionable data 
using the vertical stability criteria compared with other data sets reviewed. A 
plot of the 8 points flagged are given in figure 19. All are in the higher 
gradient region of the upper 250 decibars. The salinity of station 33 appears 
to be .025 psu to high from the surface to 4 decibars (see figure 20) and there 
is a temperature inversion of 0.075 C between 4 and 6 dbars that may not be 
real (figure 21). Table I are the density inversion values plotted on figure 19 
together with station number and pressure.

P16A17A FINAL REPORT FOR LARGE VOLUME SAMPLES AND DELTA14C MEASUREMENTS
(Robert M. Key)
July 7, 1996


1.0  GENERAL INFORMATION

WOCE cruise P16A17A was the first of three legs carried out aboard the R/V Knorr 
in the south central and southeastern Pacific Ocean. The WHPO designation for 
this leg was 316N138_9 (A.K.A. Juno-1). Joe Reid of SIO was chief scientist. 
This report covers details of data collection and analysis for the large volume 
Gerard samples. To the best of my knowledge, no final report for this cruise has 
been produced. The cruise departed Papeete, Tahiti on October 6, 1992 and 
returned to Papeete on November 25, 1993.

Fourteen large volume (LV) stations were occupied on this leg. The planned sam- 
pling density was 1 station every 5° of latitude (~300nmi). The basic WOCE plan 
for LV stations included one deep cast (2500db to the bottom), and one inter-
mediate (1000db to 2500db) cast. For the southern end of the P16 section on this 
leg, only 1 near bottom cast was taken at each LV station to improve horizontal 
resolution. In the event of mistripped Gerard sampler(s), casts were repeated as 
time allowed in an attempt to collect the full suite of samples. All LV casts 
for the Juno cruises were done using the starboard-aft crane and coring cable on 
the R/V Knorr. The purpose of these casts was to collect samples for 14C analy-
sis. 14C coverage for the upper water column was done via small volume AMS 
sampling from the Rosette. AMS sample analysis is not yet completed.

Table 1 summarizes the LV sampling and Figure 1 shows the station positions for 
leg P16A17A.

Each Gerard barrel was equipped with a piggyback 5 liter Niskin bottle which, in 
turn, had a full set of high precision reversing thermometers to determine 
sampling pressure and temperature. Both Gerard and Niskin were sampled for 
salinity and silicate. Additionally, each Gerard was sampled for radiocarbon. 
The salinity samples from the piggyback bottle were used for comparison with the 
Gerard barrel salinities to verify the integrity of the Gerard sample. As each 
sample was collected, data were recorded on a sample log sheet. Normal sampling 
practice was to open the drain valve before opening the air vent to see if water 
escaped, indicating the presence of an air leak in the sampler. This observation 
("air leak"), and other comments ("lanyard caught in lid", "valve left open", 
etc.) which may indicate some doubt about the integrity of the water samples 
were noted on the log sheets. The discrete hydrographic data were entered into 
the shipboard data system and processed as the analyses were completed. The 
bottle data were brought to a usable, though not final, state at sea. ODF data 
checking procedures included verification that the sample was assigned to the 
correct depth. The salinity and nutrient data were compared with those from 
adjacent stations and with the Rosette cast data from the same station. Any 
comments regarding the water samples were investigated. The raw data computer 
files were also checked for entry errors.


2.0  PERSONNEL

LV sampling for this cruise was under the direction of the principal 
investigator, Robert M. Key (Princeton). All LV 14C extractions at sea were done 
by Key. In addition to Key, deck work was done by the SIO CTD group (primarily 
John Boaz, Jim Wells and Leonard Lopez) with assistance from the scientific 
party. Lopez, Wells and Key were responsible for reading thermometers. 
Salinities and nutrients were analyzed by SIO-ODF. 14C analyses were performed 
at Göte Ostlund's laboratory (U. Miami, R.S.M.A.S.). Minze Stuiver made the 13C 
measurements which are necessary to correct the 14C values for fractionation 
effects. Key collected the data from the originators, merged the files, assigned 
quality control flags to the 14C, rechecked the flags assigned by ODF and 
submitted the data files to the WOCE office (7/96).


3.0  RESULTS

This data set and any changes or additions supersedes any prior release. In this 
data set Gerard samples can be differentiated from Niskin samples by the bottle 
number. Niskin bottle numbers are in the range 41-49 while Gerards are in the 
range 81-93.

3.1  PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE

Pressure and temperature for the LV casts are determined by reversing thermome- 
ters mounted on the piggyback Niskin bottle. Each bottle was equipped with the 
standard set of 2 protected and 1 unprotected thermometer. Each temperature 
value reported on the LV casts is calculated from the average of four readings, 
provided both protected thermometers functioned normally. The temperatures are 
based on the International Temperature Scale of 1990. All thermometers, 
calibrations and calculations were provided by SIO-ODF. Reported temperatures 
for samples in the thermocline are believed to be accurate to 0.01°C and for 
deep samples 0.005°C. Pressures were calculated using standard techniques 
combining wire out with unprotected thermometer data. In cases where the 
thermometers failed, pressures were estimated by thermometer data from adjacent 
bottles combined with wire out data. Because of the inherent error in pressure 
calculations and the finite flushing time required for the Gerard barrels, the 
assigned pressures have an uncertainty of approximately 10 dB. The pressures 
recorded in the data set for each Gerard- Niskin pair generally differ by 
approximately 0.5 dB with the Gerard pressure being the greater. This is because 
the Niskin is hung near the upper end of the Gerard. Figure 2 shows potential 
temperature vs. pressure for the LV casts. CTD values from the same stations and 
pressure ranges are indicated on the plot as connected, small filled squares.

3.2  SALINITY

Salinity samples were collected from each Gerard barrel and each piggyback Ni- 
skin bottle. Analyses were performed by the same personnel who ran the salt 
samples collected from the Rosette bottles so the analytical precision should be 
the same for LV salts and Rosette salt samples. When both Gerard and Niskin trip 
properly, the difference between the two salt measurements should be within the 
range 0.000 - 0.003 on the PSU scale. Somewhat larger differences can occur if 
the sea state is very calm and the cast is not "yo-yo'd" once the terminal wire 
out is reached. This difference is due to the flushing time required for the 
Gerard barrels and the degree of difference is a function of the salinity 
gradient where the sample was collected. In addition to providing primary 
hydrographic data for the LV casts, measured salinity values help confirm that 
the barrels closed at the desired depth.

Salinity samples were drawn into 200 ml Kimax high alumina borosilicate bottles 
after 3 rinses, and were sealed with custom-made plastic insert thimbles and 
Nalgene screw caps. This assembly provides very low container dissolution and 
sample evaporation. As loose inserts were found, they were replaced to ensure a 
continued airtight seal. Salinity was determined after a box of samples had 
equilibrated to laboratory temperature, usually within 8-12 hours of collec- 
tion. The draw time and equilibration time, as well as per-sample analysis time 
and temperature were logged.

A single Guildline Autosal Model 8400A salinometer located in a temperature 
controlled laboratory was used to measure salinities. The salinometer was 
standardized for each cast with IAPSO Standard Seawater (SSW) Batch P-120, using 
at least one fresh vial per cast. The estimated accuracy of bottle salinities 
run at sea is usually better than 0.002 PSU relative to the particular Standard 
Seawater batch used. PSS-78 salinity (UNESCO 1981) was then calculated for each 
sample from the measured conductivity ratios, and the results merged with the 
cruise database. There were some problems with lab temperature control through-
out cruise; the Autosal bath temperature was adjusted accordingly. Salinities 
were generally considered good for the expedition despite the lab temperature 
problem. The quality of the temperature and salinity is demonstrated by Figure 3 
which shows data from all of the large volume samples overlain by CTD/Rosette 
data from the same stations. Each Gerard-Niskin pair is assigned the same 
temperature which allows direct comparison of the paired salinity values on the 
figure.

3.3  NUTRIENTS

Nutrient samples were collected from Gerard samples. On this leg silicate values 
were measured on all samples. LV nutrients were measured along with Rosette 
nutrients so the analytical precision for Gerard samples should be the same as 
Rosette samples. Nutrients collected from LV casts are frequently subject to 
systematic offsets from samples taken from Rosette bottles. For this reason it 
is recommended that these data be viewed primarily as a means of checking sample 
integrity (i.e. trip confirmation). The Rosette- Gerard discrepancy is frequent-
ly less for silicate than for other nutrients. For the area covered by this leg, 
deep silicate values are as useful for trip confirmation as salt measurements.

Nutrient samples were drawn into 45 ml high density polypropylene, narrow mouth, 
screw-capped centrifuge tubes which were rinsed three times before filling. 
Standardizations were performed with solutions prepared aboard ship from pre-
weighed chemicals; these solutions were used as working standards before and 
after each cast to correct for instrumental drift during analysis. Sets of 4-6 
different concentrations of shipboard standards were analyzed periodically to 
determine the linearity of colorimeter response and the resulting correction 
factors.

Nutrient analyses were performed on an ODF-modified 4 channel Technicon Au- 
toAnalyzer II, generally within one hour of the cast. Occasionally some samples 
were refrigerated at 2 to 6°C for a maximum of 4 hours. The methods used are 
described by Gordon et al. (1992), Atlas et al. (1971), and Hager et al. (1972). 
All peaks were logged manually, and all the runs were re-read to check for 
possible reading errors.

Silicate was analyzed using the technique of Armstrong et al. (1967). ODF''s 
methodology is known to be non-linear at high silicate concentrations (>120 mM); 
a correction for this non-linearity was applied. Phosphate was analyzed using a 
modification of the Bernhardt and Wilhelms (1967) technique.

Na 2 SiF 6 , the silicate primary standard, was obtained from Fluka Chemical 
Company and Fischer Scientific and is reported by the suppliers to be >98% pure. 
Primary standards for phosphate, KH2 PO4 , were obtained from Johnson Matthey 
Chemical Co. and the supplier reports purity of 99.999%.

Nutrients, reported in micromoles per kilogram, were converted from micromoles 
per liter by dividing by sample density calculated at zero pressure, in-situ 
salinity, and an assumed laboratory temperature of 25°C. The overall quality of 
the silicate data for this cruise is demonstrated in Figure 4 which shows both 
Gerard and piggyback Niskin silicate values as a function of potential 
temperature. Overlain on the plot (connected, small filled squares) are the 
Rosette measurements for the same stations and depth ranges.

3.4  14C

Some of the delta 14C values reported here have been distributed in a data 
report produced by Ostlund (1995). That report included preliminary hydrographic 
data and is superseded by this submission.

All Gerard samples deemed to be "OK" on initial inspection at sea were extracted 
for 14C analysis using the technique described by Key (1991). The extracted 
14CO2/NaOH samples were returned to the Ocean Tracer Lab at Princeton and 
subsequently shipped to Ostlund's lab in Miami. Both 13C and 14C measurements 
are performed on the same CO2 gas extracted from the large volume samples. The 
13C analyses were done in M. Stuiver's lab at the Univ. Washington. The standard 
for the 14C measurements is the NBS oxalic acid standard for radiocarbon dating. 
R-value is the ratio between the measured specific activity of the sample CO2 to 
that of CO2 prepared from the standard, the latter number corrected to a d 13C 
value of -19o/oo and age corrected from today to AD1950 all according to the 
international agreement. delta 14C is the deviation in o/oo from unity, of the 
activity ratio, isotope corrected to a sample d 13C value of -25o/oo. For 
further information of these calculations and procedures see Broecker and Olson 
(1981), Stuiver and Robinson (1974) and Stuiver (1980). Ostlund's lab reports a 
precision of 4o/oo for each measurement based on a long term average of counting 
statistics. Of the 165 Gerard samples collected, 14C has been measured on 131 
(79%). Existing 14C data for the area sampled on this cruise is limited to a few 
GEOSECS measurements and the WOCE Juno-2 cruise. Comparison of these data sets 
indicates that they are in agreement to the precision of the measurements.


4.0  DATA SUMMARY

Figures 5 & 6 summarize the large volume 14C data collected on this leg. All 
delta 14C measurements with a quality flag value of 2 are included in each 
figure. Figure 5 shows the delta 14C values plotted as a function of pressure . 
The stations taken north of ~45°S (14, 95, 105, 113 & 119) all have the mid-
depth minimum which is characteristic of the deep Pacific. Stations 22-80 are 
essentially uniform in concentration from 2000 dB to the bottom and are first 
order indistinguishable from the deep values collected somewhat further to the 
south on Juno-2. Station 87 is intermediate with three samples having lower 
concentration due to the addition of low delta 14C water similar to that seen at 
stations further north at the same depth. Figure 6 shows the delta 14C values 
plotted against measured Gerard barrel silicate values. The angled heavy line is 
the relationship suggested by Broecker et al. (1995) to be representative of the 
mean global pre-bomb delta 14C - silicate correlation. Three distinct trends can 
be seen in Figure 6:

 The linear trend between low silicate (~50µmol/kg) high delta 14C (~-120o/oo) 
  waters of the upper thermocline and high silicate (~125µmol/kg) low delta 14C 
  (~-215o/oo) waters found at mid-depth (~2400 dB). This is the trend which 
  should be useful in predicting pre-bomb near surface delta 14C. For these 
  samples which were all taken north of 45°S, the least squares relationship is 
  delta 14C = -61 ± 2 + -1.30 ± 03Si with an R2 of 0.987. The intercept value is 
  not too different from Broecker's (1995) value of -70, but the slope is
  significantly steeper than his estimate of -1.

 The second trend is made of samples collected at stations south of 45°S which 
  have essentially uniform delta 14C at ~155o/oo and a limited silicate range of 
  100-130µmol/kg.

 The third trend is made up of deep water samples collected depths below the 
  silicate maximum - delta 14C minimum. Like the samples in the first trend, 
  these all come from stations which are north of 45°S. These samples have 
  almost uniform silicate, range from 120-125µmol/kg and a delta 14C range of -
  155o/oo - - 220o/oo. The three water types are more easily seen in Figure 7. 
  In this figure, the top panel indicates the latitude range covered in each of 
  the three lower panels. The lower left panel demonstrates the circumpolar 
  water trend, the lower right demonstrates the typical South Pacific deep and 
  bottom water trend, and the center panel is intermediate (Station 87).


5.0  QUALITY CONTROL FLAG ASSIGNMENT

Quality flag values were assigned to all bottles and all measurements using the 
code defined in Tables 0.1 and 0.2 of WHP Office Report WHPO 91-1 Rev. 2 
sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 respectively. In this report the only bottle flag 
values used were 2, 3, 4, and 9. For the measurement flags values of 2, 3, 4, 5 
or 9 were assigned. The interpretation of measurement flag 5 or 9 is unambig-
uous, however the choice between values 2, 3 or 4 involves some interpretation. 
For this data set, the salt and nutrient values were checked by plotting them 
over the same parameters taken from the rosette at the same station. Points 
which were clearly outliers were flagged "4". Points which were somewhat outside 
the envelop of the other points were flagged "3". In cases where the entire cast 
seemed to be shifted to higher or lower concentrations (in nutrient values), but 
the values formed a smooth profile, the data was flagged as "2". Once the 
nutrient and salt data had been flagged, these results were considered in 
flagging the 14C data. There is very little overlap between this data set and 
any existing 14C data, so that type of comparison was impractical. In general 
the lack of other data for comparison led to a more lenient grading on the 14C 
data. When flagging 14C data, the measurement error was taken into considera-
tion. That is, approximately one-third of the 14C measurements are expected to 
deviate from the true value by more than the measurement precision of ~4 o/oo. 
No measured values have been removed from this data set. When using this data 
set, it is advised that the nutrient data only be considered as a tool for 
judging the quality of the 14C data regardless of the quality code value. A 
summary of all flags is provided in Table 2. Since no inventory data was 
available when preparing this table, flag values 5 and 9 were used synonymously. 
For example, the phosphate, nitrate and nitrite values which are flagged "5 - 
not reported" may never have been collected. If this is the case, the flag 
should be 9. Regardless, the end result is the same there is no value for those 
bottles.

P16A17A FINAL REPORT FOR AMS 14C SAMPLES
(Robert M. Key)
April 3, 1997


1.0  GENERAL INFORMATION

WOCE cruise P16A17A was the first of three legs carried out aboard the R/V 
Knorr in the south central and southeastern Pacific Ocean. The WHPO designation 
for this leg was 316N138_11. Joe Reid of SIO was chief scientist. The cruise 
departed Papeete, Tahiti on October 6, 1992 and returned to Papeete on November 
25, 1992. The cruise consisted of two meridional sections along 155°W and 
135°W. The reader is referred to cruise documentation provided by the chief 
scientist as the primary source for cruise information.

This report covers details of the small volume radiocarbon samples. The AMS 
station locations are shown in Figure 1 and summarized in Table 1. A total of 
627 samples were collected at the 37 stations sampled for delta14C. Thirteen of 
the stations were also sampled using the large vol-ume technique. The results 
of the large volume sampling program were reported by Key (1996).

2.0  PERSONNEL

14C sampling for this cruise was carried out by R. Key from Princeton U. 14C 
analyses were performed at the National Ocean Sciences AMS Facility (NOSAMS) at 
Woods Hole Ocean-ographic Institution. Salinities, nutrients and oxygen were 
analyzed by the SIO CTD group. Key collected the data from the originators, 
merged the files, assigned quality control flags to the 14C and submitted the 
data files to the WOCE office (4/97) and is P.I. for the 14C data.


3.0  RESULTS

This 14C data set and any changes or additions supersedes any prior release.

3.1  HYDROGRAPHY

Hydrography from this leg has been submitted to the WOCE office by the chief 
scientist and described in the final hydrographic reports.

3.2  14C

The delta14C values reported here were originally distributed in two data 
reports (NOSAMS, July 31, 1995 & March 3, 1997). Those reports included 
preliminary results which had not been through the WOCE quality control 
procedures. This report supersedes those data distributions.

All of the AMS samples from this cruise have been measured. Replicate 
measurements were made on 14 of the water samples. These replicate analyses are 
tabulated in Table 2. The table shows the error weighted mean and uncertainty 
for each set of replicates. The uncertainty is defined here as the larger of 
the standard deviation and the error weighted standard deviation of the mean. 
For these replicates, the average uncertainty is 4.7o/oo. This precision 
estimate is approx-imately correct for the time frame over which these samples 
were measured (Mar.-Jul., 1995 and Jul.-Dec., 1996). Note that the errors given 
in the final data report (with the exception of the repli-cates) include only 
counting errors, and errors due to blanks and backgrounds. The uncertainty 
obtained for replicate analyses is an estimate of the true error which includes 
errors due to sample collection, sample degassing, etc.

4.0  QUALITY CONTROL FLAG ASSIGNMENT

Quality flag values were assigned to all delta14C measurements using the code 
defined in Table 0.2 of WHP Office Report WHPO 91-1 Rev. 2 section 4.5.2. 
(Joyce, et al., 1994). Measure-ment flags values of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 have been 
assigned. The choice between values 2 (good), 3 (questionable) or 4 (bad) 
involves some interpretation. There is little overlap between this data set and 
any existing 14C data, so that type of comparison was difficult. In general the 
lack of other data for comparison led to a more lenient grading on the 14C 
data.

When using this data set for scientific application, any 14C datum which is 
flagged with a "3" should be carefully considered. My subjective opinion is 
that any datum flagged "4" should be disregarded. When flagging 14C data, the 
measurement error was taken into consideration. That is, approximately one-
third of the 14C measurements are expected to deviate from the true value by 
more than the measurement precision (~4.7o/oo). No measured values have been 
removed from this data set, therefore a flag value of 5 implies that the sample 
was totally lost somewhere between collection and analysis. Table 3 summarizes 
the quality control flags assigned to this data set. For a detailed description 
of the flagging procedure see Key, al. (1996).

5.0 DATA SUMMARY 

Figures 2-5 summarize the delta14C data collected on this leg. Only delta14C 
measurements with a quality flag value of 2 ("good") or 6 ("replicate") are 
included in each figure. Figure 2 shows the delta14C values with 2s error bars 
plotted as a function of pressure (circles). Large volume results from this 
cruise are also shown in Figure 2 (triangles) for comparison. The data 
distribution in this figure demonstrates the scheme for the small volume 
sampling - AMS samples were used primarily to cover the surface and thermocline 
waters while large volume samples covered deep and bottom waters (at a 
significantly decreased density). The deep AMS samples collected on this leg 
were primarily substitutes for large volume sampling when the weather was too 
harsh to allow Gerard bottle casts. Two distinct trends are present in Figure 
2. The stations south of the circum-polar frontal regions have surface delta14C 
values ranging from -25 to -100o/oo. The values in these profiles decrease to 
approximately -160o/oo over the upper kilometer of the water column then remain 
essentially constant from there to the bottom. The profiles collected at 
stations which were north of the frontal region have delta14C values of 50 to 
125o/oo near the surface, decrease through the thermocline to a minimum at a 
depth of approximately 2.5 kilometers, then increase toward the bottom to 
values that are the same as seen in the southern stations. The uniform 
concentration over most of the depth range at the southern stations is due to 
intense vertical mixing and the fact that the isopycnals are extremely steep in 
this area. More interesting is the fact that the waters around Antarctica are 
so old. Toggweiler et al. (1997) have recently presented arguments that the 
extreme age is due to the fact that most of the deep and bottom water sinking 
in this area is formed from "old" southward flowing waters at mid depths in the 
Pacific and Indian Oceans. Addition-ally, it is likely that the upwelled waters 
around Antarctica are not at the surface long enough to reach equilibrium with 
the atmosphere and therefore have anomalously low delta14C values. Worth noting 
is the fact that this conclusion is in direct conflict with recent work by 
Peacock and Bro-ecker (1997) who argue that approximately 15 Sv of deep water 
must be formed in the Southern Ocean based mass balance calculations using 
radiocarbon and PO4 * .

Figure 3 shows the delta14C values plotted against silicate.The straight line 
shown in the fig-ure is the least squares regression relationship derived by 
Broecker et al. (1995) based on the GEOSECS global data set. According to their 
analysis, this line (delta14C = -70 - Si) represents the relationship between 
naturally occurring radiocarbon and silicate for most of the ocean. They 
interpret deviations in delta14C above this line to be due to input of bomb-
produced radiocarbon, however, they note that the interpretation can be 
problematic at high latitudes. It is unlikely that the points falling above the 
line with silicate concentrations greater than 100 mm/kg are elevated due to 
the addition of bomb-produced delta14C. If the GEOSECS Pacific data from the 
same latitude range were added to Figure 3, the points would fall within the 
envelop of the WOCE data. The two trends discussed in reference to Figure 2 are 
evident in Figure 3 only for silicate concentra-tions greater than about 90 
mm/kg. In this region the points in the upper cluster are from the south-ern 
stations and those in the lower cluster from the stations north of the 
circumpolar frontal region. If the southern stations were eliminated and a 
regression calculated for the deep (>1 km) waters of the northern stations, the 
intercept would be higher and the slope steeper than the global line estimated 
by Broecker. Regardless, those samples having silicate concentrations lower 
than approximately 30 mm/kg are clearly contaminated with bomb produced 
radiocarbon.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 show contoured sections of the delta14C distribution for 
the two merid-ional sections occupied during this cruise. In both figures, the 
large volume data was included to help fill out the data set. The "A" portion 
of each figure shows the data plotted as a section in depth - latitude space 
and the "B" portion shows data from the upper 1.5 kilometers of the water 
column in potential density (sigma-theta) - latitude space. The data in these 
sections were girded using the "loess" methods described in Chambers et al. 
(1983), Chambers and Hastie (1991), Cleveland (1979) and Cleveland and Devlin 
(1988). Figure 4 shows the section which runs approximately along 155°W and 
Figure 5 the section on 135°W.

Not surprisingly, the two depth sections are quite similar. Both show a minimum 
at the north end of the section centered around 2.5 km depth. This is the same 
minimum which is present throughout the Pacific and is thought to be coincident 
with the return flow of old waters from the north. Below the minimum are 
generally northward flowing - somewhat younger waters which originated in the 
circumpolar region. In the upper kilometer of the water column for both 
sections, the delta14C isolines have a strong upward gradient between 50°S and 
60°S in the vicinity of the circumpolar current. The delta14C=-160o/oo contour 
deepens from north to south, reaching max-imum depth at approximately 55-56°S 
and 2.0 km before turning sharply upward.

As with the depth sections, the potential density sections (4B & 5B) are 
similar. It is evi-dent in these figures, however, that while the two sections 
had the same southern extent, the sur-face waters were quite different. The 
only implication of this is that the circumpolar current was displaced further 
south at 135°W than at 155°W. South of 30°S the delta14C isolines with values 
between -20o/oo and -120o/oo are nearly flat and parallel except very near the 
southern outcrop region where they show a slight deepening. The near-surface 
isolines at the north end of P17A are higher than those at the north end of 
P16A simply because this section extends further north (Note that both the 
horizontal and vertical scales are different for 4B and 5B).

FINAL CFC DATA QUALITY EVALUATION (DQE) COMMENTS ON P16AP17A.
(David Wisegarver)
Dec 2000


During the initial DQE review of the CFC data, a small number of samples were 
given QUALT2 flags which differed from the initial QUALT1 flags assigned by the 
PI. After discussion, the PI concurred with the DQE assigned flags and updated 
the QUAL1 flags for these samples.

The CFC concentrations have been adjusted to the SIO98 calibration Scale (Prinn 
et al. 2000) so that all of the Pacific WOCE CFC data will be on a common 
calibration scale.

          I already gave you p19c (which I see is in P19Cdoc).  I thought it 
          was redundant to put long names in every filename, so I made the 
          directory name with the cruise lines, and the files are all the 
          same.  The figs files are all figxx.ps (where xx should indicate 
          the figure numbers referenced in the documentation).  I also 
          included ps and ascii versions of the original documentation and 
          applicable appendices.  (appendix a and b will be missing - they 
          are outdated now and shouldn't be included in anything.)

          Merged %deltaHe and molal[He] data into BTL file. Merging notes

          Merged 2 helium data files into BTL file.
          
          **Note: some helium data already exsist in current BTL file.  Not 
          sure where it came from.  However, data in two files to be merge 
          will not overwrite any existing helium data (different stations). 
          I am a little suspicious of some helium values that existed in BTL 
          file.  There are several instances of %deltaHe = 000.00 (flag 2), 
          and molal[He] = 0.0000 (flag 1).  Possible these were bad merges? 
          Should values be -999.00 and -9.000 and flagged 5?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------07/09/00  Anfuso        He/Tr           Corrected Quality flags, remerged

          The quality flags in the hyd file were not correct for previously 
          merged tritium data. I suspect there were errors in the hyd file when 
          SIOWHPO received this data set. The errors were confusing and not 
          consistent from station to station.  Also, all quality words contained 
          a trailing '1' that didn't seem to be associated with any data 
          property.

          The original Helium/tritium data file was saved in ...1997/juno1.trt. 
          I reran mrgsea in attempt to remerege the tritium data and associated 
          flags; this did not correct the problem. I verified that the tritium 
          in the exsisting hyd file was exactly what was in the 
          ...1997/juno1.trt file. Using a privious version of the hyd file, 
          p16ahy_rplcd_2000.08.31.txt, I removed the lagging '1' from the 
          quality word, then removed the existing tritium data column 
          (reformatted file, not incorporating tritium column). Then, I remerged 
          the juno1.trt tritium values. After verifying that all parameters had 
          a properly positioned matching flag, I merged into this file new EVANS 
          helium data.

          FILE in this directory: juno1_edt.trt : this is a modification of the 
          original tritium data in ...1997/juno1.trt. 
             I removed all data except the tritium data and associated flags for 
             merging.
          p16ahy_notritium.txt: this is the p16ahy_rplcd_2000.08.31.txt hyd data

             (removed tritium and lagging '1' in quality word).


          p16ahy_trt.dat: this is the corrected hyd data file with tritium and 
          data flag correctly merged.
             copied to p16a dir as p16ahy.txt. Then, merged in new EVANS helium 
             data and saved this file to origina/p16ahy_rplcd_2000.09.07.txt

          message, i would like to ask you to make public all ldeo woce 
          tritium/he data that have been submitted to you.  because the 
          tritium/he community has not yet finished the final calibration of 
          the data, i might have to apply minor corrections to these data 
          once the intercal. effort has been completed.  our acce work was 
          funded over a 5-year period that ended in 2000.  consequently, 
          this data set is further behind in quality control before 
          submission, but i expect that we will get these data ready soon.
          
          SR3 was never funded in a 'regular' fashion, but i used noaa corc 
          funds to keep the measurements of this sample set moving. i expect 
          to finish the analyses this summer and submit them in fall.

          An oceanographically-insignificant error in CTDTMP data for this 
          cruise has been found (ca. -0.00024*T - 0.00036 degC).  A data update 
          is forthcoming. In the interim the corrected data files can be 
          obtained from: ftp://odf.ucsd.edu/pub/HydroData/woce/crs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------06/20/01  Johnson      CTD              Data Update; Processing error corrected
          revised data available by ftp  ODF has discovered a small error in the 
          algorithm used to convert ITS90 temperature calibration data to 
          IPTS68.  This error affects reported Mark III CTD temperature data for 
          most cruises that occurred in 1992-1999.  A complete list of affected 
          data sets appears below.

          ODF temperature calibrations are reported on the ITS90 temperature 
          scale.  ODF internally maintains these calibrations for CTD data 
          processing on the IPTS68 scale.  The error involved converting ITS90 
          calibrations to IPTS68.  The amount of error is close to linear with 
          temperature: approximately -0.00024 degC/degC, with a -0.00036 degC 
          offset at 0 degC.  Previously reported data were low by 0.00756 degC 
          at 30 degC, decreasing to 0.00036 degC low at 0 degC.  Data reported 
          as ITS90 were also affected by a similar amount.  CTD conductivity 
          calibrations have been recalculated to account for the temperature 
          change.  Reported CTD salinity and oxygen data were not significantly 
          affected.
          
          Revised final data sets have been prepared and will be available soon 
          from ODF (ftp://odf.ucsd.edu/pub/HydroData).  The data will eventually 
          be updated on the whpo.ucsd.edu website as well.
          IPTS68 temperatures are reported for PCM11 and Antarktis X/5, as 
          originally submitted to their chief scientists.  ITS90 temperatures 
          are reported for all other cruises.

          Changes in the final data vs. previous release (other than temperature 
          and negligible differences in salinity/oxygen):
          S04P:  694/03 CTD data were not reported, but CTD values were reported 
          with the bottle data.  No conductivity correction was applied to these 
          values in the original .sea file.  This release uses the same 
          conductivity correction as the two nearest casts to correct salinity.
          AO94:  Eight CTD casts were fit for ctdoxy (previously uncalibrated) 
          and resubmitted to the P.I. since the original release.  The WHP-
          format bottle file was not regenerated.  The CTDOXY for the following 
          stations should be significantly different than the original .sea file 
          values:
              009/01 013/02 017/01 018/01 026/04 033/01 036/01 036/02 
          I09N: The 243/01 original CTD data file was not rewritten after 
          updating the ctdoxy fit.  This release uses the correct ctdoxy data 
          for the .ctd file.  The original .sea file was written after the 
          update occurred, so the ctdoxy values reported with bottle data should 
          be minimally different.

03/11/02  Schlosser    TRITUM           Data Update  See Note:  we have 
          gone through all juno tritium data and flagged them according to 
          woce procedures. we also plotted sections to check if there are 
          flyers in the data set. the final step we have to complete before 
          submission is to determine the cosmogenic tritium that we subtract 
          from the present numbers. this is only relevant for very low 
          tritium concentrations such as those found in the southern ocean 
          deep and bottom waters (ca. 0.005 to 0.01 TU). i hope that we can 
          finish this by tomorrow and then submit the final tritium and 
          helium isotope numbers to the whpo.

          Peter - thanks - OK, will flag it as questionable. But the 
          value in the WHPO file is 0.112 (not 0.011 as in your email) - 
          (station 81, bottle 24) - I'll double check this against the 
          original submission as well.

06/17/02  Schlosser    TRITUM           Update Needed  See Note:
          We only have two data points from this station. I agree that 
          the second value (0.011) is high in comparison to all the other 
          values from this depth range. we probably should flag it as 
          'questionable' data point.
