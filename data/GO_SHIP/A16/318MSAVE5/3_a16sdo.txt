      CHIEF SCIENTIST'S OVERVIEW
      
      Leg 5 of SAVE (denoted Hydros 3 by Scripps, and A16C for the WOCE project) 
      was carried out on the R/V Melville and was actually a combination of a 
      meridional section across the Argentine Basin at 41°W and a short section 
      perpendicular to the western boundary at about 35°S planned as part of 
      SAVE, and the southern end of a meridional. long line in the Atlantic 
      Ocean planned by M. McCartney, L. Talley and M. Tsuchiya that extended 
      from 32.5°S, 25°W to South Georgia Island
      
      The cruise departed from Cape Town on January 23,1989 at 1400. The first 
      station, a reoccupation of AJAX station 44 at 36°S, 1°E, was taken on 
      January 26. Work began on the 25°W line on February I with station 237 
      taken at 32°30' S, 25°00' W. The southernmost station (278) just north 
      of South Georgia Island was taken on February 17. The station spacing 
      was about 30 na. mi. along this line. The section along 41°W (stations 
      279-304) was occupied between February 18 and March 2 with a station 
      spacing of about 65 na. mi. The portion of the western boundary section 
      outside Uruguay's 200 mile zone (stations 305-308) was taken between 
      March 4 and March 6. Stations inside Uruguay's 200 mile zone were taken 
      on the following leg when an Uruguayan observer was on board. The cruise 
      ended in Montevideo on March 8, one day later than scheduled. The one 
      day delay was caused by a breakdown of the main engine, which was 
      repaired at sea.
      
      The total number of miles steamed was 5989 and the total number of CTD-
      rosette stations occupied was 73. These stations were taken using a Neil 
      Brown CTD interfaced to a Scripps Ocean Data Facility rosette equipped 
      with thirty-six 10 liter bottles. At 13 of the stations large volume 
      samples were collected using Gerard barrels. Generally 18 large volume 
      samples were collected between the surface and the bottom. The total 
      steaming time for the cruise was 25 days, 15 hours and the total station 
      time was 17 days, 5 hours. Originally, 81 stations had been planned, but 
      8 stations were dropped because of time lost during rough weather. 
      Approximately 1.25 days were lost because of slow steaming and greater 
      time required to complete casts in rough weather and an equal amount of 
      time us lost because of equipment failures during rough weather. Most of 
      the equipment failures were Gerard barrels not tripping properly and 
      breaks in the CTD termination.1.

      INTRODUCTION  
      
      The broad objectives of the South Atlantic Ventilation Experiment (SAVE) 
      are to investigate the rates of ocean circulation, mixing, ventilation, 
      inter-ocean exchange, and carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycling on an 
      ocean basin scale. Transient and radioactive tracers are well suited for 
      pursuing these objectives because they integrate over various spatial 
      and temporal scales, providing strong constraints on time-averaged rates 
      of circulation and mixing, and revealing pathways between the air/sea 
      interface and the abyssal ocean that are not always discernible from 
      traditional hydrographic and nutrient observations. The results should 
      lead to a better understanding of the ocean's major role in the earth's 
      climate, via its control of the global heat and carbon dioxide budgets.
      
      The specific problems that will be addressed include:
      
      1) Exchange of South Atlantic waters with the North Atlantic, Pacific, 
         Antarctic and Indian Oceans,
      2) Formation and spreading rates of intermediate waters,
      3) Thermocline ventilation rates and locations,
      4) Rates of biologically-mediated metabolic processes,
      5) Diapycnic processes,
      6) Origins of deep and bottom waters and their spreading routes and 
         rates.

      Underway/XBT Program

      XBT casts were usually taken between CTD stations. Where the station 
      spacing was 30nm, one XBT was taken and for greater spacing 2 XBTs were 
      taken. The XBT casts were accompanied by water samples for dissolved 
      oxygen, pCO2, salinity and nutrients taken from the Melville's clean 
      seawater line.

      Bathymetry

      Depth was measured continuously along the entire cruise track using a 
      12KHz precision depth recorder. The raw data was digitized by hand at 5-
      minute intervals and a tape of the reduced data will be produced by the 
      Geological Data Center at Scripps.

      2.  BOTTLE DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSES, AND PROCESSING
      
      ODF CTD/rosette casts were carried out with a 36-bottle rosette sampler 
      of ODF manufacture using a General Oceanics pylon. An ODF-modified NBIS 
      Mark 3 CTD and a SeaTech transmissometer provided by Texas A&M 
      University (TAMU) were mounted on the rosette frame. Seawater samples 
      were collected in 10-liter PVC Niskin bottles mounted on the rosette 
      frame. These bottles were numbered 1 through 36, if one of these 36 
      bottles needed servicing and repairs could not be accomplished by the 
      next cast, the replacement bottle was numbered 71-78. Added CTD levels, 
      no water samples, were assigned bottle numbers 95-99. Subsets of CTD 
      data taken at the time of water sample collection (a 10 second average) 
      were transmitted to the bottle data files immediately after each cast to 
      provide pressure and temperature at the sampling depth, and to 
      facilitate the examination and quality control of the bottle data as the 
      laboratory analyses were completed.
      
      After each rosette cast was brought on board, water samples were drawn 
      in the following order: Freon, Helium-3, Oxygen, Oxygen-18, pCO2. …CO2, 
      Tritium, Nutrients, Salinity and Suspended Particulate Matter. Other 
      ancillary program samples were drawn after the core samples. The samples 
      and the Niskin sampler they were drawn from were recorded on the Sample 
      Log sheet. Comments regarding validity of the water sample (valve open, 
      lanyard caught in lid, etc.) were also noted on the Sample Log sheets.
      
      Table 1 is a tabulation of samples collected during all six legs [SAVE 
      Legs 1 through 5 (STS/ODF, 1992) and HYDROS Leg 4 (STS/ODF, 1992)] 
      unless otherwise noted and includes the Principal Investigators and 
      their institutions. Samples collected on each station are tabulated in 
      the Station and Cast Description.
      
      Gerard casts were carried out with -270 liter stainless steel Gerard 
      barrels on which were mounted 2-liter Niskin bottles with reversing 
      thermometers. Samples for salinity, 14C, 228Ra, 39Ar, and 85Kr Were 
      obtained from the Gerard barrels. The Gerard barrels were numbered 81 
      through 91 and the piggy-back Niskin were numbered 41 through 70. 
      Surface samples taken from the ship's underway pump line were assigned a 
      bottle number of 98 through 99. Salinity check samples were always drawn 
      from the Niskin bottles for comparison with the Gerard barrel salinities 
      to try to verify the integrity of the Gerard sample. Occasionally, 
      barium and some of the samples normally taken from the rosette were also 
      drawn from the Gerard-mounted Niskin bottle. These were also recorded on 
      a Sample Log sheet.
      
      The discrete hydrographic data were entered into the shipboard data 
      system and processed as the analyses were completed. The bottle data 
      were brought to a useable, though perhaps not final, state at sea. ODF 
      data checking procedures included verification that the sample was 
      assigned to the correct level. This was accomplished by checking the raw 
      data sheets, which included the raw data value and the water sample 
      bottle, versus the sample log sheets. Any comments regarding the water 
      samples were investigated. The raw data computer files were also checked 
      for entry errors. Investigation of data included comparison of bottle 
      salinity and oxygen with CTD data, and review of data plots of the 
      station profile alone and compared to nearby stations.
      
      If a data value did not either agree satisfactorily with the CTD or with 
      other nearby data, then analyst and sampling notes, plots, and nearby 
      data were reviewed. If any problem was indicated the data value was 
      flagged or deleted. (However, ODF preserves in its archives all bottle 
      data values). The Bottle Data Processing Notes section includes comments 
      regarding deletion of samples.
      
      If it was determined that an entire 10 liter water sample was 
      contaminated by leakage or other bottle or rosette malfunction, the 
      level is reported with just the CTD data (pressure, temperature and 
      salinity). This has been done to preserve the profile and accommodate 
      investigators who prefer using bottle data files exclusively.

      2.1. PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURES
      
      All pressures and temperatures for the Niskin bottle data tabulations on 
      the rosette casts were extracted from the processed CTD data, usually 
      those from the corrected 10-second average bottle trip files collected 
      during the up cast (see CTD DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSES, AND PROCESSING).
      
      Gerard pressures and temperatures were calculated from Deep-Sea 
      Reversing Thermometer (DSRT) readings. Each DSRT rack normally held 2 
      protected (temperature) thermometers and I unprotected (pressure) 
      thermometer. Thermometers were read by two people, each attempting to 
      read a precision equal to one tenth of the thermometer etching interval. 
      Thus, a thermometer etched at 0.05 degree intervals would be read to the 
      nearest 0.005 degrees. Each temperature value is therefore calculated 
      from the average of four readings.

          IT SHOULD BE CLEARLY NOTED THAT THE TEMPERATURES PRODUCED AND 
          PUBLISHED BY ODF IN THIS REPORT ARE BASED ON THE INTERNATIONAL 
          PRACTICAL TEMPERATURE SCALE OF 1968, RATHER THAN THE CURRENTLY 
          USED INTERNATIONAL TEMPERATURE SCALE OF 1990. 
                (The expedition took place before I January 1990, 
                          the starting date for ITS-90).
      

      2.2. SALINITY
      
      Salinity samples were drawn into ODF citrate salinity bottles which were 
      rinsed three times before filling. Salinity was determined after sample 
      equilibration to laboratory temperature, usually within about 8-36 hours 
      of collection. Salinity has been calculated according to the equations 
      of the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (UNESCO, 198 1) from the 
      conductivity ratio determined from bottle samples analyzed (minimum of 
      two recorded analyses per sample bottle after flushing) with a Guildline 
      Autosal Model 8400A salinometer standardized against Wormley P- 108 
      standard seawater, with at least one fresh vial opened per cast, or from 
      the corrected CTD conductivity, temperature, and pressure.
      
      Accuracy estimates of bottle salinities run at sea are usually better 
      than 0.002 psu relative to the specified batch of standard. Although 
      laboratory precision of the Autosal can be as small as 0.0002 psu when 
      running replicate samples under ideal conditions, at sea the expected 
      precision is about 0.001 psu under normal conditions, with a stable lab 
      temperature. Still, because a small droplet of fresh water, or the 
      residue from a small evaporated droplet of seawater, can affect a bottle 
      salinity in the third decimal place, and because the Autosal salinometer 
      is sensitive to environmental fluctuations, salinities from bottle 
      samples have a lower true precision under field conditions than in the 
      laboratory. ODF typically deleted the Niskin bottle salinity from this 
      report, and substituted the corrected CTD salinity, whenever there was 
      any question regarding its validity (see BOTTLE DATA PROCESSING NOTES).
      

      2.3. OXYGEN
      
      Samples were collected for dissolved oxygen analyses soon after the 
      rosette sampler was brought on board and after CFC and Helium were 
      drawn. Nominal 100 ml volume iodine flasks were rinsed carefully with 
      minimal agitation, then filled via a drawing tube, and allowed to 
      overflow for at least 2 flask volumes. Reagents were added to fix the 
      oxygen before stoppering. The flasks were shaken twice; immediately, and 
      after 20 minutes, to assure thorough dispersion of the Mn(OH)2 
      precipitate. The samples were analyzed within 4-36 hours.
      
      Dissolved oxygen samples were titrated in the volume-calibrated iodine 
      flasks with a I ml microburet, using the whole-bottle Winkler titration 
      following the technique of Carpenter (1965). Standardizations were 
      performed with 0.01N potassium iodate solutions prepared from pre-
      weighed potassium iodate crystals. Standards were run at the beginning 
      of each session of analyses, which typically included from I to 3 
      stations. Several standards were made up and compared to assure that the 
      results were reproducible, and to preclude basing the entire cruise on 
      one standard, with the possibility of a weighing error. A correction (-
      0.014 ml/l) was made for the amount of oxygen added with the reagents. 
      Combined reagent/seawater blanks were determined to account for 
      oxidizing or reducing materials in the reagents, and for a nominal level 
      of natural iodate (Brewer and Wong, 1974) or other oxidizers/reducers in 
      the seawater.
      
      The assay of the finest quality K103 available to ODF is 100%, ±0.05%, 
      but the true limit in the quality of the bottle oxygen data lies in the 
      practical limitations of the present sampling and analytical 
      methodology, from the time the rosette bottle is closed through the 
      calculation of oxygen concentration from titration data. Overall 
      precision within a group of samples has been determined from replicates 
      on numerous occasions, and for the system as employed on this 
      expedition, one may expect ±0.1 to 0.2%. The overall accuracy of the 
      data is estimated to be ±0.5%.

      Oxygens were converted from milliliters per liter to micromoles per 
      kilogram using the equation:

             O2[µm/kg]=O2[ml/l]/(.022392*(1.0+sigma theta/1000.0))
      
      The potential density anomaly, sigma theta, is the potential density in 
      kg/m3 referenced to pressure=0, from which 1000 has been subtracted.
      

      2.4. NUTRIENTS
      
      Nutrients (phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite) analyses, reported 
      in micromoles/kilogram, were performed on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer(r). 
      The procedures used are described in Hager et al. (1972) and Atlas et 
      al. (1971). Standardizations were performed with solutions prepared 
      aboard ship from pre-weighed standards; these solutions were used as 
      working standards before and after each cast (approximately 36 samples) 
      to correct for instrumental drift during analyses. Sets of 4-6 different 
      concentrations of shipboard standards were analyzed periodically to 
      determine the linearity of colorimeter response and the resulting 
      correction factors. Phosphate was analyzed using hydrazine reduction of 
      phosphomolybdic acid as described by Bernhardt & Wilhelms (1967). 
      Silicate was analyzed using stannous chloride reduction of 
      silicomolybdic acid. Nitrite was analyzed using diazotization and 
      coupling to form dye; nitrate was reduced by copperized cadmium and then 
      analyzed as nitrite. These three analyses use the methods of Armstrong 
      et al. (1967).
      
      Sampling for nutrients followed that for the tracer gases, CFCs, He, 
      Tritium, and dissolved oxygen. Samples were drawn into -45 cc high 
      density polyethylene, narrow mouth, screw-capped bottles which were 
      rinsed twice before filling. The samples may have been refrigerated at 2 
      to 6°C for a maximum of 15 hours.
      
      Nutrients were converted from micromoles per liter to micromoles per 
      kilogram by dividing by sample density calculated at an assumed 
      laboratory temperature of 25°C.

      3. CTD DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSES, AND PROCESSING
      
      Year-2 of SAVE (Legs 4 and 5) were processed with Hydros-4 therefore 
      there may be references made to Hydros-4. 209 CTD casts were completed 
      using a 36-bottle rosette sampling system; 64 casts were completed on 
      Save Leg 4, 74 on Save Leg 5 one of which was a test and not reported in 
      this report, and 71 casts on Hydros-4. STS/ODF CTDs #1 and #2, modified 
      NBIS Mark IIl-B instruments, were both used during SAVE-4; CTD-1 was 
      used exclusively on SAVE-5 and Hydros-4. The CTD data were initially 
      processed into a filtered, half-second average time-series during the 
      data acquisition. The pressure and PRT temperature channels were 
      corrected using laboratory calibrations. The conductivity/salinity 
      channels were calibrated to salinity check samples acquired on each 
      cast. The CTD time-series data were then pressure-sequenced into 2-
      decibar pressure intervals, and the pressure series oxygen channel was 
      corrected to match oxygen check samples acquired on each upcast.
      

      3.1. CTD LABORATORY CALIBRATIONS
      3.1.1. PRESSURE TRANSDUCER CALIBRATION
      
      Each CTD pressure transducer was calibrated in a temperature-controlled 
      bath by comparison with pressures generated by a Ruska Model 2400 piston 
      gage. The mechanical hysteresis loading and unloading curves were 
      measured both pre- and post-cruise at cold temperature (-I to 0.5°C 
      bath) to a maximum of 8830 psi, and at warm temperature (28-30°C bath) 
      to a maximum of 2030 psi.
      
      3.1.2. PRT TEMPERATURE CALIBRATION
      
      The CTD-1 and all CTD-2 PRT temperature sensors were calibrated in a 
      temperature-controlled bath by comparison with temperatures calculated 
      from the resistance of a Rosemount Model 162CE standard platinum 
      thermometer, measured by a NBIS model ATB 1250 resistance bridge. The 
      Rosemount standard PRT was checked periodically in water and diphenyl 
      ether triple-point cells. Seven or more calibration temperatures, spaced 
      across the range of 0 to 30°C, were measured both pre- and post-cruise. 
      The CTD-2 primary PRT temperature transducer was replaced after SAVE-4, 
      station 185, so the pre- and post-cruise calibrations for that 
      temperature channel are not comparable.
      
      
      3.2. CTD DATA PROCESSING
      3.2.1. CTD DATA ACQUISITION
      
      Eight data channels (pressure, temperature, second temperature, 
      conductivity, dissolved oxygen, transmissometer, altimeter and elapsed 
      time) were acquired by CTD-2 at a data rate of 25 Hz. CTD-1 acquired 
      seven cbannels, having only one temperature transducer. The FSK CTD 
      signal was demodulated by an STS/ODF-designed deck unit and output to an 
      RS-232 bus interface. An Integrated Solutions, Inc. (ISI) Optimum V 
      computer served as the real-time data acquisition processor.
      
      Data acquisition consisted of storing all raw binary data on hard disk, 
      then on magnetic cartridge tape, and generating a corrected and filtered 
      half-second average time-series. Data calculated from this time series 
      were reported and plotted during the cast. A 10-second average of the 
      time-series data was calculated for each water sample collected during 
      the data acquisition.
      
      Generating the half-second time-series data set involved applying 
      single-frame absolute value and gradient filters, then performing a two-
      pass 4,2 standard-deviation data rejection to all channels. During the 
      acquisition, the pre-cruise laboratory calibration data were applied to 
      pressure and temperature. Pressure, conductivity and oxygen were matched 
      to the thermal response of the PRT temperature transducer. This lag time 
      was determined using raw CTD data from the cruise. The conductivity and 
      oxygen channels were corrected for thermal and pressure effects.
      
      3.2.2. PRESSURE, TEMPERATURE AND CONDUCTIVITY/SALINITY CORRECTIONS
      
      A maximum of 36 salinity and oxygen check samples, plus 4 thermometric 
      pressure and temperature measurements, were collected during each CTD 
      cast. A 10-second average of the CTD time-series data was calculated for 
      each trip time sample. The resulting data were then used to verify the 
      pre- and post-cruise pressure and temperature calibrations, and to 
      derive CTD conductivity/salinity and oxygen corrections.
      
      3.2.2.1. CTD PRESSURE CORRECTIONS
      3.2.2.1.1. CTD #2

      The pre- and post-cruise pressure calibrations were compared. The 
      warm/shallow calibration curve shifted by almost 3 decibars from pre- to 
      post-cruise, and the cold/deep calibration curve shifted by 3.5 
      decibars. There were no notable slope differences between the two sets 
      of calibrations. Offsets are adjusted automatically for each station as 
      the CTD enters the water, so there were no significant differences 
      between the two calibration results for CTD-2.
      
      Since all CTD-2 casts were done during the first of the three Hydros 
      legs, closer to the pre-cruise calibrations, no change was made to the 
      shipboard CTD-2 pressure data, to which the pre-cruise pressure 
      calibrations had already been applied. Thermometric pressures collected 
      during the CTD-2 casts were minimal because of numerous lanyard hangups 
      or other problems. The few acceptable check-pressure differences gave no 
      indication of any problems with the CTD-2 calibrated pressures.
      
      3.2.2.1.2. CTD #1

      The laboratory calibration for CTD-1 at the end of Hydros-4 disclosed a 
      pressure problem affecting all three Hydros (SAVE/Year-2) legs:
      
      a.  Although pre- and post-cruise pressure calibrations matched (to 
          within 0.2 decibars) below 1190 decibars, the 0-decibar calibration 
          point differed by 2.5 decibars (loading) and 3 decibars (unloading) 
          between pre- and post-cruise.
      b.  There was a sudden 6-decibar jump in pressure response between the 
          1050- and 1190-decibar calibration points on the loading curve during 
          the post-cruise calibration.
      c.  The jump does not appear in the unloading curve, but shallower than 
          the 1400-decibar point, the post-cruise begins to deviate from the 
          pre-cruise calibration to a maximum of 3 decibars at the 0-decibar 
          calibration point.
      d.  The post-cruise pressure calibration was repeated, giving similar 
          results.
      
      The pre-cruise calibrations were re-checked, and a smaller/shallower 
      indication of the same problem could be seen on the cold loading curve 
      at 365 decibars. CTD-1 downcasts from all three legs of the cruise were 
      checked for sudden pressure shifts between 800 and 1600 decibars.
      
      The CTD-1 half-second time-series downcasts were checked for a ratio of 
      pressure difference to time difference ("r") greater than 2.5 
      (equivalent to a winch speed of 150 m/min). For each station with a 
      sudden pressure shift visible on Pressure vs. Time plots, there was 
      exactly one area where r was between 4 and 13. All but six of the jumps 
      occurred between 1000 and 1550 decibars, where the temperature ranged 
      from about 2.5 to 4°C. The other six jumps, between 900 and 1000 
      decibars, occurred during casts at the beginning of SAVE-4 and at the 
      end of Hydros-4 All detectable rapid changes in pressure occurred in 0.6 
      to 1.5 seconds and were 1.5 to 10.2 decibars in magnitude.
      
      95 out of 192 CTD-1 casts were affected by a pressure jump as described 
      above. There were problems on many sequential casts, then no detectable 
      problem for many more casts in a row. The pressure at which the jump 
      occurred, and the magnitude of the jump, seemed to be random: there was 
      no apparent correlation to water temperature or elapsed time from the 
      cruise start.
      
      A "baseline" pressure correction curve was generated by averaging the 
      pre- and post-cruise calibration curves for each of the shallow/warm and 
      deep/cold data sets, then removing the 500- to 1500-decibar distortion 
      of the post-cruise calibrations by using the shape of the more typical 
      pre-cruise curve. This averaged out the surface differences and 
      maintained the deep consistency in the calibrations. This average 
      correction curve was used for all casts in which no pressure problem was 
      detected.
      
      Customized pressure corrections were generated for problem casts, as 
      identified by areas of r greater than 3.5. The "baseline" curve 
      described in the previous paragraph was used as the starting point for 
      each cast. The "average" curve was used from the surface to 365 decibars 
      and from the post-"jump" pressure to the bottom. The correction for the 
      beginning pressure of the jump was the post-jump correction value plus 
      the jump size, minus the real pressure change occurring in that time. A 
      straight-line correction was used between 365 decibars down and the 
      beginning pressure of the jump on the cold curve.
      
      The average upcast calibration curves were retained for each cast unless 
      the last corrected in-water surface pressure of an upcast was less than 
      -0.6 decibars. In these cases, the upcast correction curve was adjusted 
      by 0 at 365 decibars to a maximum of +1.5 decibars at the surface, which 
      allowed the curve to resemble the shape of the pre-cruise curve in cases 
      where the end-pressure warranted it.
      
      The corrections applied were intended to correct the distorted pressures 
      to within 2 decibars to maintain the WOCE CTD salinity standards. It 
      should be noted that other problems may still exist, but are not 
      detectable at this time. CTD-1 pressure data above 1600 decibars should 
      not be considered accurate to better than 2 decibars, while deeper data 
      should be within more typical error ranges.
      
      Thermometric pressures collected during the casts were compared with 
      CTD- 1 corrected pressure data. Any differences between the two sets of 
      pressures appeared to be rack-dependent.
      
      3.2.2.2. CTD TEMPERATURE CORRECTIONS
      3.2.2.2.1. CTD #2
      
      CTD-2 had two PRTs. PRT-1 was the main temperature sensor and began 
      drifting during station 177, seven stations into SAVE-4. The drifting 
      increased by stations 183-185, where it was finally isolated as a 
      temperature problem rather than a conductivity problem. PRT-2 was a 
      secondary temperature sensor installed to provide a check for the 
      primary PRT; it was used as the primary PRT for stations 177-185 and 
      210. PRT-2 was not located as near to the conductivity sensor as PRT-1 
      and therefore generated noisier CTD salinity data, as it was measuring 
      slightly different water and could not be matched properly to the 
      conductivity sensor response. CTD-2 was used for all stations from 171-
      185, plus 210 and 218: CTD-2 was re-installed at these last two stations 
      to test the new PRT-1 sensor, to ensure that CTD-2 could be used as a 
      backup if CTD-1 failed later in the expedition.
      
      The pre- and post-cruise laboratory temperature transducer calibrations 
      for PRT-1 were not comparable because a new sensor was installed during 
      SAVE-4 PRT-1a and PRT-2 data from the pre-cruise laboratory calibration 
      and from shipboard casts were compared to see if the relative difference 
      between them changed. There was good agreement between these two CTD-2 
      PRTs, the differences being consistent at calibration, within a given 
      station, and from station to station. No shift in either sensor occurred 
      until station 176, when the difference increased by .002. Since PRT- la 
      began shifting noticeably in the same direction during station 177, an 
      additional +.002 temperature offset was applied to station 176 data, 
      assuming some change may have begun at that time.
      
      A new sensor (PRT-1b) was installed in CTD-2 after station 185. The CTD 
      was used/tested during station 210, where PRT-1b also displayed a 
      drifting problem. CTD-2 was worked on again, then tested at station 218:
      
      PRT-1b functioned normally and was used as the CTD-1 primary PRT for 
      that cast. PRT-1b and PRT-2 differences from station 218 and the post-
      cruise calibration were compared. The post-cruise difference was an 
      average -.022 compared to the station 218 difference. PRT-2 shifted by 
      -.013 from pre-cruise to post-cruise laboratory calibrations, which 
      points to a -.035 shift in PRT-1b between station 218 and the post-
      cruise calibration. Two deep thermometric temperatures from station 218 
      also support this shift. The post-cruise PRT-1b laboratory calibration 
      curve, with an additional -.035 offset, was applied to station 218 CTD 
      temperature data.
      
      A comparison of the pre- and post-cruise laboratory CTD-2/PRT-2 
      temperature transducer calibrations showed an average -.013°C shift for 
      PRT-2. There was also a small slope difference between the two PRT-2 
      calibrations. Since CTD-2 was used mostly at the beginning of the 
      expedition and there is no evidence to show that PRT-2 shifted by the 
      last cast it was used for, the pre-cruise PRT-2 laboratory temperature 
      calibration was applied to stations 177-185 and 210 CTD data.
      
      The few thermometric temperature differences available for comparison 
      with CTD-2 data support the temperature corrections used. Additional 
      verification of the temperature corrections was obtained by comparing 
      bottle salinity differences vs. CTD values generated from corrected 
      pressure and temperature, plus raw conductivity. There were no sudden 
      shifts in preliminary salinity differences on casts where a different 
      primary PRT was used or when temperature corrections were offset from 
      the laboratory calibrations.
      
      3.2.2.2.2. CTD #1
      
      CTD-1 had a single temperature sensor and was used for stations 186 
      through 379, except stations 210 and 218. A comparison of the pre- and 
      post-cruise laboratory CTD-1 PRT temperature transducer calibrations 
      showed a shift varying from -.001°C at cold temperatures to -.0017 at 
      warm temperatures. An average of the two laboratory calibrations was 
      applied to the CTD-1 temperature data.
      
      Thermometric temperature data from the cruise were compared to the 
      calibrated CTD-1 temperature data. Any offsets in the differences tended 
      to correlate with thermometer rack number, no shifts in CTD-1 
      temperature data could be detected over the course of the cruise.
      
      3.2.2.3. CTD CONDUCTIVITY CORRECTIONS
      3.2.2.3.1. CTD #2

      Check-sample conductivities were calculated from the bottle salinities 
      using CTD-2 pressures and temperatures. The differences between sample 
      and CTD conductivities at all pressures were fit to CTD conductivity 
      using a linear least-squares fit. A conductivity correction slope was 
      not warranted at that time.
      
      Conductivity differences were then calculated: offsets were determined 
      for each cast and fit to station number. Preliminary offsets were 
      applied to stations 171 through 175 individually, based on conductivity 
      differences at pressures below 100 decibars. Stations 176-185 
      conductivity differences below 1000 decibars were re-fit, and smoothed 
      offsets were applied to those casts. Stations 210 and 218 conductivity 
      offsets were determined individually based on differences below 1000 
      decibars. The offsets were manually adjusted to account for 
      discontinuous shifts in the conductivity transducer response, or to 
      insure a consistent deep theta-S relationship from station to station.
      
      After applying the conductivity offsets, the need for a conductivity 
      slope as a function of conductivity was reevaluated: no slope was 
      required.
      
      3.2.2.3.2. CTD #1
      
      Check-sample conductivities were calculated from the bottle salinities 
      using CTD pressures and temperatures. The differences between sample and 
      CTD-1 conductivities at all pressures were fit to CTD conductivity using 
      a linear least-squares fit. Values greater than 2 standard deviations 
      from the fit were rejected. The resulting conductivity correction slope 
      was applied to each CTD-1 cast.
      
      Conductivity differences were calculated for each cast after applying 
      the preliminary conductivity slope correction. Residual conductivity 
      offsets were then computed for each cast and fit to station number. 
      Smoothed offsets were determined in three groups: stations 186-189 
      (first-order fit), stations 190-202 (0-order/same offset for all casts) 
      and stations 203-379 (0-order/same offset for all casts). The resulting 
      smoothed offsets were then applied to the data, then conductivity slope 
      as a function of conductivity was re-checked: no change was warranted. 
      Some offsets were manually adjusted to account for discontinuous shifts 
      in the conductivity transducer response, or to insure a consistent deep 
      theta-S relationship from station to station.
      
      It was noted that stations 190-202 had numerous casts of inconsistent 
      bottle data values caused by a scum buildup in the Autosal cell. Adding 
      to this problem were CTD-1 conductivity offsetting problems caused by 
      sensor fouling on stations 192 and 202. The Autosal was thoroughly 
      cleaned and checked before station 200 deep salts were run, and the CTD 
      conductivity sensor was thoroughly cleaned both before and after station 
      202. No effect on conductivity values was noted after opening up CTD-1
      two separate times to repair the non-functioning multiplexer channel 
      (after stations 192 and 255).
      
      3.2.2.3.3. BOTTLE VS. CTD CONDUCTIVITY STATISTICAL SUMMARY
      
      The Hydros (SAVE/Year-2) calibrated bottle-minus-CTD conductivity

                      generating the results.
      
      
      3.2.3. CTD DISSOLVED OXYGEN DATA
      3.2.3.1. CTD OXYGEN CORRECTIONS
      
      Dissolved oxygen data were acquired using a Sensormedics dissolved 
      oxygen sensor. During the three legs of the cruise, three oxygen sensors 
      were used. The original sensor on CTD #2 was used for stations 171 
      through 183, then failed during station 184. A replacement sensor did 
      not work on stations 185 and 210, then functioned normally on station 
      218 following various repairs. The CTD #1 oxygen sensor was used for all 
      other CTD casts except station 279, where a new sensor faded; the 
      original sensor was re-installed.
      
      CTD raw oxygen currents were extracted from the downcast pressure-series 
      data (upcast for station 202) at isopycnals corresponding to the upcast 
      check-samples. The differences between CTD and check-sample dissolved 
      oxygens were used to generate coefficients for the sensor model on a 
      station-by-station basis. Bottle oxygen values were weighted as needed 
      to optimize the fitting of CTD oxygen to discrete bottle samples.
      
      3.2.3.2. BOTTLE VS. CTD OXYGEN STATISTICAL SUMMARY
      
      After the CTD oxygen fitting was completed, the upcast bottle values 
      were compared to the corrected CTD oxygen values. The bottle-minus-CTD 
      oxygen differences resulted in the statistics below:

                                  Mean oxygen

      3.2.4. ADDITIONAL PROCESSING
      
      A software filter was used on a third of the casts to remove larger 
      conductivity or temperature spiking problems. Additionally, oxygen 
      spikes were filtered out of nearly half of the casts. Pressure did not 
      require filtering 0.35% of the time-series data were affected by the 
      filter. Two-thirds of the spiking problems were concentrated in the CTD-
      2/PRT-2 casts, where the distance between the secondary PRT and the 
      conductivity sensor resulted in poor signal match-up in high-gradient 
      areas, and station 202, with its fouled-sensor problem. After filtering, 
      the downcast (upcast for station 202) portion of each time-series was 
      pressure-sequenced into 2-decibar pressure intervals. A ship-roll. 
      filter was applied to each cast to disallow pressure reversals.
      
      The remaining density inversions in high-gradient regions cannot be 
      accounted for by a mis-match of pressure, temperature and conductivity 
      sensor response. Detailed examination of the raw data shows significant   
      mixing occurring in these areas because of ship roll. The ship-roll 
      filter resulted in a reduction in the amount and size of density 
      inversions.
      

      3.3. GENERAL COMMENTS/PROBLEMS
      
      There were 212 CTD rosette casts: three of these (station 178 casts 2 
      and 3, plus station 328 cast 1) were aborted because of various computer 
      problems, but another CTD cast was done immediately afterward at the 
      same locations. There is one pressure-sequenced CTD data set, to near 
      the ocean floor, for each of 209 stations. The data reported is all from 
      downcasts, excepting station 202, which is an upcast. The effect of the 
      initial sensor fouling on station 202's downcast was not possible to 
      filter out, while the upcast problems were mostly resolvable.
      
      The 0-decibar level of some casts was extrapolated using a quadratic fit 
      through the next three deeper levels. Recorded surface values were 
      rejected only when it appeared that the drift was caused by sensors 
      adjusting to the in-water transition; if there were any question that 
      the that the surface values might be real, the original data was 
      reported.
      
      Several shipboard time-series data sets had areas of missing or noisy 
      data. These casts were recovered by redigitizing the raw signal from 
      analog tape. A total of 9 data levels were interpolated in 8 casts: the 
      pressures for these interpolated data frames are listed in the CTD 
      Processing Notes as well as other shipboard or processing comments 
      regarding individual casts.
      
      During conductivity data calibrations it was noticed that there was an 
      apparent +.002 conductivity offset in the deep data for some stations. 
      This apparent offset appeared in both the downcasts and upcasts for the 
      affected stations. A similar phenomenon has been noticed before in this 
      and other CTDs where the raw conductivity value crosses from 32.768 to 
      32.767. On some stations, a -.002 shift back appears yet deeper, where 
      the raw conductivity value crosses back over to 32.767 from the other 
      direction. This is a problem specific to certain instruments, and 
      currently there is no correction. It is most noticeable in Atlantic 
      Ocean data because this particular conductivity crossover" value 
      typically occurs in deep water, where salinity is stable over many 
      hundreds of meters.
      
      The CTD oxygen sensor often requires several seconds in the water before 
      being wet enough to respond properly; this is manifested as low or high 
      CTD oxygen values at the start of some casts. Flow-dependence problems 
      occur when the lowering rate varies, or when the CTD is stopped, as at 
      the cast bottom or bottle trips, where depletion of oxygen at the sensor 
      causes lower oxygen readings. CTD downcast oxygen data are usually 
      smoother than upcast data because of the more constant lowering rate. 
      Station 202, the only upcast, demonstrates the typical oxygen depletion 
      effect at each bottle stop. Any delays or stops during the downcasts 
      that may have similarly affected the CTD oxygen data are documented in 
      the CTD Processing Notes.
      
      There were various winch, wire or rosette problems throughout the 
      cruise. These resulted in occasional stops, pauses or yoyos during 
      casts. Only those problems that may have affected the data continuity 
      have been noted. As mentioned above, these changes in the lowering rate 
      can affect oxygen in particular.

      4. DATA TABLES AND PLOTS
      4.1. STATION AND CAST DESCRIPTION
      
      Latitudes and longitudes were read from the ship's navigation system. 
      The time (GMT) is the beginning of the CTD up cast or the time the 
      messenger was sent for the Gerard casts. The bottom depth was read from 
      the PGR, and corrected according to Carter Tables (Carter, 1980). The 
      value (in meters) in the column "DAB" (Distance above bottom) was 
      obtained from the PGR, unless the "Comments" column reports altimeter, 
      as was the ocean depth. Note that the maximum sampling depth for the 
      Rosette casts is calculated from the corrected CTD data since the 
      deepest bottle may not have been closed at the deepest CTD sampling 
      point. If less than 36 bottles were sampled for the Rosette casts or 9 
      barrels for the Gerard casts, the number of samples taken are reported 
      in the comments. The complementary programs are reported in the 
      "Samples" column.
      

      4.2. TABULAR DATA, CTD, ROSETTE AND GERARD
      
      Station numbers are consecutive from the beginning to end of the cruise, 
      without interruption. Cast numbers are consecutive at each station, 
      including aborted casts. Meteorological data were collected by the 
      ship's officers and were copied from the Melville's Bridge Log. If more 
      than one CTD cast were done on a station, the deepest cast is reported.
      
      The headings in both the CTD data and ROSETTE and GERARD bottle data 
      have been abbreviated to PRESS, TEMP, and O2 for pressure (decibars), 
      temperature (degrees Celsius), and oxygen which is reported in both 
      (milliliters per liter) and (micromoles per kilogram). In the CTD data 
      listings, specific volume anomaly (centiliters/ton) was abbreviated SVA 
      and calculated according to Millero et al. (1980) and Fofonoff et al. 
      (1983), Sound Velocity (meters per second) to SVEL, (Chen and Millero, 
      1977), Dynamic Height (dynamic meters) to DYN HT, (Sverdrup et al., 
      1942), Vaisla Frequency (cycles per hour) to VAIS FREQ which uses a 
      subroutine by Bob Millard modified by Lynne Talley to incorporate 
      Gaussian weighting after the formulation of Breck Owens and N. P. 
      Fofonoff. In the bottle data listings, the headings have been 
      abbreviated to SAW NUM and SALT for Sample Number and Salinity 
      (Practical Salinity Units), AOU, PO4, NO3, SiO3, and NO2 for apparent 
      oxygen utilization, phosphate, nitrate, silicate, and nitrite 
      (micromoles/kilogram), respectively. Density anomalies in sigma-notation 
      follow the usual practice; e.g. sigma-theta (or sigma-0) is the 
      potential density in kg/m3 referenced to pressure=O, from which 1000 has 
      been subtracted. Potential temperature, 0, (degrees Celsius) has been 
      calculated according to Fofonoff (1977) and Bryden (1973) and depth 
      (meters) by Saunders (1981) and Mantyla (1982-1983).
      
      Throughout the bottle data report alphabetic characters may be found in 
      the tabular data. These characters have the following meaning:
      
      D  A salinity value, normally from a bottle sample, has been taken from 
         CTD records.
      G  Data value appears to be high or low as compared with the station 
         profile, however as compared with CTD trace the sample appears good.
      H  A pressure or temperature value, normally from CTD records, has been 
         taken from reversing thermometers.
      L  The sample bottle appears to have leaked. This usually refers to 
         Gerard barrels or the piggy-back Niskin and indicates that the samples 
         may be contaminated.
      P  The sampler either pre or post-tripped. This usually refers to Gerard 
         barrels and indicates that the samples may be contaminated.
      U  A data value is suspect, although no obvious reason has been found.
      
      Comments and investigation of these values are reported in the 
      appropriate leg's Bottle Data Processing Notes section. Surface samples 
      from the ship's underway pump line were assigned a separate cast number 
      and reported in the data table under the heading GERARD. This was not 
      the caw on Leg 4, these samples may have the rosette data cast number. 
      These surface samples are distinguished by an "H" footnote on the 
      pressure and reported in the GERARD section.
      

      4.3. STATION PLOTS
      
      The hydrographic station plots provide a visualization of the data that 
      is not possible from listings. The first few overlay plots represent the 
      entire leg. Then for each station, the upper plots on the even numbered 
      pages are CTD data, the lower two plots are bottle data. The odd 
      numbered pages are single station representation of potential 
      temperature vs. oxygen, phosphate, nitrate and silicate.

      BOTTLE DATA PROCESSING NOTES
      
      Remarks for deleted or missing samples and footnoted data from SAVE Leg 
      5. Uncertainty of data (footnoted data) results in values that may not 
      fit the station profile, but are within the accuracy of the measurement. 
      Investigation of data may include comparison of bottle salinity and 
      oxygen with CTD data, comparison of Niskin/Gerard salinity, review of 
      data plots of station profile and adjoining stations, rereading of 
      charts (i.e., nutrients). CTD data is reported instead of bottle 
      salinity when comments refer to deleted salinity samples or missing for 
      various reasons. Oxygen and nutrient values are referred to in ml/l and 
      µm/l, respectively. On Gerard casts, if there is a comment regarding the 
      Niskin bottle the corresponding Gerard barrel number follows the Niskin 
      number (i.e., 153/183 is Niskin 53 and Gerard 83).

               NO3=33.9, SiO3=119.1).
      129      delta-S .004 high at 14OOdb. Calc ok. CTD trace smooth 
               and indicates sal max closer to 1500db. No notes. No apparent 
               problems with other water samples. Delete bottle salinity 
               (34.720).
               
      
      STATION  283
      135      Sample Log: Lid not closed. 5m above 136. Suspended 
               particles checked on sample log. Deck Log note: "top of Niskin 35 
               did not close completely slightly askew." No other samples drawn 
               @1714db so sample integrity unknown.
               
      
      STATION  284
      131      Discrete O2 .2 high at 1297db. Calc ok. CTDO down & up 
               traces show min not max this level. O2 values similar to 132 
               value so possibly drawn from Niskin32 in error. Delete bottle 
               oxygen 
               (4.39).
      287      Sample Log: Went down without washer on valve arm. Assume 
               means no o-ring on valve cap. Niskin Gerard S=.003 at 889db. 
               Probable slight leak. Suggested footnote: "No o-ring on valve 
               cap. Probable slight leak." "L"
               
      
      STATION  286

               samples also ok.
      122      Discrete O2 .1 high. Calc ok. No notes. CTDO shows 
               feature this level both down & up but only about 1/2 as high. 
               Nutrients & salt also have feature but salt is proportional to 
               CTD down & up traces. Suggest: FOOTNOTE "U"
               
      
      STATION  287
      112      Sample Log: Air leak, sample leaked out on deck. No water 
               samples drawn @801db.
      113      delta-S .014 high at 948db. Calc ok. High gradient. 
               Nutrients ok (NO3 & PO4 max). O2 problem apparently unrelated is 
               described below. O2 value appears about .07 high at 948db 
               compared to CTDO down & up traces. Oxygen analyst indicated 
               sample was over-titrated, but sample does not give good results. 
               Delete bottle oxygen (4.00).
      259      Sample Log: No salts drawn. Sampling error @5203db, they 
               should have been. Freon & barium were drawn. Gerard (#289) salt 
               agrees well with CTD salt trace.
      260      Sample Log: No salts drawn. Sampling error @5380db, they 
               should have been. Freon & barium were drawn. Gerard (290) salt 
               agrees well with CTD salt trace.
      353      Salinity: "top loose" Niskin-Gerard S=.009 at 208db. 
               Gerard salt looks ok. Delete Niskin salinity (34.147).
               
      
      STATION  291
      160      Niskin-Gerard S=.005 at 5449db. Calc ok. No notes. Gerard 
               (190) salt agrees with CTD and other Argon cast salts this level. 
               No other samples taken Niskin 160. Delete Niskin salinity 
               (34.671).
               
      
      STATION  292
      130      SIL 1.6 higher than 131 SIL tripped at same level 
               (4198db). 131 value in better agreement with adjacent values and 
               130 has poor peak. Delete silicate value (129.3).

      121      delta-S .018 low at 2198db. Calc ok. Same value as 120 
               salt so possible dupe draw. CTDs noisy but not this much. O2 & 
               PO4 look ok. NO3 1.0 high and SIL 2.0 high. NO3 peak poor, SIL 
               peak ok. Calc ok. Delete bottle salinity (34.773).
      136      Discrete O2 @5242db .33 ml/L high compared to adjacent 
               samples and CTDO traces. Calc ok. Assume bad draw or titration. 
               Deleted bottle oxygen (5.51).
      257/288  Thermometer: Lanyard hang-up, therms did not reverse. No 
               temperature @4716db. Sample Log: Lid not completely closed. 
               Niskin-Gerard S=-.001 at 4699db. Gerard sample ok.
      259/289  Sample Log: Air leak. Salinity: "Perhaps drawn quite 
               late" Niskin-Gerard S=-.002 but both DSRTs and salinities 
               indicate Niskin and Gerard tripped at about 2550db instead of 
               5080db as intended. Probably post-tripped. See 290. Suggested 
               footnote: "Post-trip, poor flush.".
      260/290  Sample Log: Air leak. Salinity: "Perhaps drawn quite 
               late" Niskin-Gerard S=.008 at 5241db. Gerard salt agrees with 
               rosette & CTD salts. Assume Niskin leaked. Freon & barium also 
               drawn from Niskin. Delete Niskin salinity (34.673). Gerard 
               samples looks good.
      360/392  Niskin salt low at 1476db indicating leak. No notes but 
               same Niskin leaked last cast. Barium also drawn from Niskin #60.

     The measurement of all the radiocarbon samples and the production of 
     this report were carried out under National Science Foundation Grant 
     NSF-OCE-86-13329. We are very grateful for their long term support. We 
     also thank the technical staff of the Ocean Data Facility at Scripps 
     Institution of Oceanography for the radiocarbon sample collection and 
     shipboard extraction. We sincerely appreciate the efforts of the chief 
     scientist to include as many sample collections as they did especially 
     after the untimely loss of the Gerard barrels on the first cruise of 
     this project. M. Stuiver and T. Saling at Quaternary Research Office, 
     University of Washington, made the numerous and excellent 13C 
     measurements which is hereby gratefully acknowledged.

     I.  INTRODUCTION
     
     The project called Transient Tracers in the Ocean, TTO was initiated it 
     1980 with the intent to study the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic 
     Study (NAS) and Tropical Atlantic Study (TAS) scientific cruises 
     continued only as far south as 10°S. The South Atlantic Ventilation 
     Experiment (SAVE) expeditions traversed as far south as 53°S and east to 
     Africa. Through the use of various tracers, the program investigated 
     circulation, mixing and ventilation of the South Atlantic Ocean. 
     Radiocarbon (14C) is considered an important tracer to study because it 
     helps provide information on rates of internal oceanic mixing as well as 
     the rate of gas exchange between ocean surface and atmosphere. The 
     coverage of 14C measurements from SAVE is much denser than that of its 
     predecessor, GEOSECS, and can provide a much better base upon which 
     future C02 studies can build. It also provides a view at the evolution 
     of bomb 14C distribution over the last decade since GEOSECS, as several 
     GEOSECS stations were reoccupied during SAVE.
     
     
     
     II.  CRUISE DESCRIPTIONS
     
     The SAVE expedition consisted of two cruises subdivided into six legs.
     
     A.  YEAR 1
     
     The first leg aboard the R/V Knorr, began 23 November 1987 from Recife, 
     Brazil. The Knorr crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a northeasterly course 
     and arrived into Abidjan, Ivory Coast on 13 December 1987. A total of 
     121 radiocarbon samples was collected from ten large volume stations. 
     During a deep Gerard cast on station 32, all barrels were lost when the 
     winch cable snapped. Two spare Gerard barrels were used during the 
     remainder of Leg 1, which limited sample collection to the upper 1000m 
     of depth.
     
     The Knorr departed Abidjan on 18 December 1987, heading southwest and 
     arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 23 January 1988. During Leg 2, 163 
     14C samples were collected from 21 large volume stations. With the 
     exceptions of stations 95 and 99, where deep samples were collected from 
     the core of the Antarctic Bottom Water and North Atlantic Deep Water, 
     maximum sample depth was 1000m.
     
     On Leg 3, once again armed with full complement of Gerard barrels, the 
     expedition set out on 28 January 1988, traveled southeast to about O°W 
     then heading north back to Abidjan. Before the cruise ended on 7 March 
     1988, 349 radiocarbon samples were taken at 30 large volume stations.
     
     
     B.  YEAR 2
     
     The second year of SAVE began with departure of the R/V Melville from 
     Punta Arenas, Chile on 7 December 1988. She crossed the South Atlantic 
     Ocean along 47°S to 20°W, headed northeast to 30°S before steaming due 
     east to Capetown, South Africa, arriving on 15 January 1989. During Leg 
     4, 299 radiocarbon samples were collected from 27 large volume stations.
     
     Leg 5 cruise departed Capetown on 23 January 1989. The cruise track 
     consisted of two meridional sections: the first traversing from 24°W 
     south to South Georgia Island; the second section going north along 
     41°W. A small northwest portion of the track heading toward Montevideo, 
     Uruguay ended on March 8, 1989. A total of 173 14C samples was taken on 
     20 stations.
     
     The remainder of the cruise was a meridional section called HYDROS, Leg 
     4, which ran north from SAVE station 237 to the equator along 25°W. 
     During this leg, 107 radiocarbon samples were collected from eight 
     stations. The program ended 19 April 1989. The table below summarizes 
     the sample collection and measurement.

     C.  SAMPLES STILL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS
     
     Although most of the samples collected during SAVE have been analyzed, 
     139 samples are still unmeasured and are archived at our laboratory. 
     Stations not yet analyzed are presented as tables located in the last 
     section of this report, starting on page 72. We hope that the sample 
     selection by various investigators and us has covered the major and 
     relevant ocean features explored during the two years of SAVE. In the 
     event that some questions remain that could be answered with additional 
     analyses, we intend to store the remaining samples for a few more years.
     
     
     
     III.  TECHNICAL PROCEDURES
     
     A.  SAMPLING
     
     Water samples were collected on board ship using 270 liter stainless 
     steel Gerard barrels. Shipboard extraction of C02 was performed by 
     acidifying 200 liters of seawater with 50ml of 95% sulfuric acid, and 
     bubbling through an inert C02-free gas. The released C02 was then 
     stripped from the carrier gas and re-dissolved into a 450ml bottle of 4N 
     sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The sample bottles were then shipped to the 
     Tritium Laboratory for measurement. Resulting yield, under favorable 
     conditions, was about 9 lit-atm of C02 or 95 - 98% of the total dissolved 
     C02 in the sample.
     
     
     B. PREPARATION OF SAMPLING GAS
     
     In the laboratory, C02 was released from the NaOH solution by adding 
     phosphoric acid. Nitrogen gas, the carrier, transferred C02 and any 
     other evolved gases to collection traps maintained at -196°C by liquid 
     nitrogen. After pumping on the solid C02, this gas was then passed 
     through a purification system consisting of a series of cold traps to 
     remove water vapor, and two copper-silver ovens to remove gaseous 
     electronegative impurities, mainly chlorine and oxygen. Remaining 
     impurities were removed by pumping on condensed C02 at a temperature of 
     -196°C. It is our experience that yields are about 99.7% of the total 
     C02 contained in the NaOH solution. Occasionally, yields were less than 
     optimal for counting in the large radiocarbon counters. These samples 
     were saved when possible by counting in a smaller counter for twice the 
     length of time required for a normal size sample.
     
     At this point, a small aliquot of purified gas was removed for 
     massspectrometric delta-13C analysis. The remaining gas was stored in a 
     stainless steel high pressure cylinder for 14 to 21 days before counting 
     to allow any radon to decay (half-life is 4 days). The radon apparently 
     originated from the phosphoric acid, and occasionally from the glass of 
     the NaOH bottles.
     
     Below follows a description of our standard 14C measurement technique 
     and special modification for this project.
     
     
     C. COUNTING
     
     We have four 2.5 liter and one 1 liter low-level gas proportional 
     counting tubes for 14C, using C02 gas samples. The counters are shielded 
     by 2.5 cm of selected lead, a ring of anti-coincidence Geiger counters, 
     10cm of paraffin wax, boric acid and/or borated polyethylene, and at 
     least 20 cm of iron, plus the walls and ceiling of the building. The 
     counter is filled with the sample to a working pressure of 45 psi. The 
     proper operating voltage, dependent on temperature and pressure in the 
     counter, is adjusted to produce the most efficient and stable 14C 
     detection. This is done by an external radioactive source, usually 60-
     CO. Gas amplification is continually monitored by the distribution of 
     meson counts in selected energy channels. The occurrence of radon is 
     monitored in a separate channel with each counter. Each sample is 
     counted for at least two separate periods of about 20 hours each, in 
     different counters, with an interim waiting time of at least 7 days. 
     Inconsistency between the two counts prompts an additional measurement 
     in a third counter. For the short samples in this series, two counters 
     were temporarily standardized to work at low pressure. These samples 
     were counted for a total of 4 to 6 days.
     
     
     D. BACKGROUND AND STANDARDS
     
     Background count rates, typically 3.5 cpm, are determined weekly by 
     measuring 14C-free C02 gas. The standard material for 14C measurements 
     is the NBS oxalic acid standard, RM49 and SRM4990C, for radiocarbon 
     dating. The C02 prepared from this standard is counted for two days 
     every week in each counter, to determine counting efficiency; typical 
     count rate for an ocean surface sample is 43 cpm above background.
     
     
     E. UPDATE
     
     Periodically, usually every five weeks, all measurements in all counters 
     for the preceding time period are recomputed, statistical tests are 
     applied, and results scrutinized for flaw in quality of sample counts 
     and stability of efficiency and background. This includes all measurements 
     of standards, unknown and backgrounds. Only after this step is the 
     measurement result considered final.

     Contribution from minute quantities of C02 in the original NaOH solutions 
     is measured for each batch of NaOH and appropriate corrections have been 
     applied.
     
     
     
     IV.  NOTES ON SCALES
     
     The measurement results in the ratio, r, between the measured specific 
     activity of the sample C02 and that Of C02 prepared from the NBS 
     standard. The activity value of the standard is corrected to a 
     hypothetical delta-13C value of -19‰ and age-corrected from today back 
     to AD1950, all according to international agreement. DELTA-14C is the 
     deviation, in ‰ (per mil), from unity, of the activity ratio, isotope-
     corrected to a sample delta-13C value of -25‰ Normally there is very 
     little (± 0.3‰) isotope separation in our preparation procedure. Within 
     these limits, our delta-13C values represent the state of isotope fraction-
     ation of the original seawater C02. According to this convention, each of 
     our reported DELTA-14C values is, however, normalized to the delta value it 
     would have if its delta-13C changed to -25‰, noting that the change is 
     equal to twice the change in 13C . Note that the mass of 14C is always 
     proportional to the r-value, not to DELTA-14C See Appendix 1.
     
     Dr. Minze Stuiver at the Quaternary Lab, University of Washington measured   
     the delta-13C values for this project by precision mass-spectrometry.
     
     For further explanation of these features, and information on standards, 
     cf. preface to each issue of Radiocarbon, and papers by Broecker and 
     Olson (1), Stuiver and Robinson (2) and by Stuiver and Polach (3). Also 
     refer to Appendix.
     
     
     
     V.  ACCURACY AND ERRORS
     
     Errors for delta-14C are not listed in the tables. For a normal size 
     sample the errors are 3.0 to 3.5‰ for precision and 3.5 to 4.0‰ for 
     accuracy, including all conceivable uncertainties. The small samples, 
     due to the very long counting times should be about as good.
     
     
     
     VI. HYDROGRAPHIC DATA
     
     The hydrographic data were supplied by the Ocean Data Facility (ODF), 
     Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Total C02 data were supplied by 
     Taro Takahashi, Lamont Doherty Geological Observatory at Columbia 
     University. They are presented in µmol/kg.
     
     We calculated potential temperature from in situ temperature, pressure, 
     and salinity by the equations of Bryden (4). The density (sigma-theta) 
     values were calculated according to the International one-atmosphere 
     equation of state of seawater according to Millero and Poisson (5), 
     which generates absolute densities in units of kg/m3.  For serious use 
     of the hydrographic, data, please refer to the Scripps Institution of 
     Oceanography SAVE Data Reports; S.I.0. Reference 92-9, 92-10 and 92-12. 
     For total C02 data please contact Taro Takahashi.

         ON THE MEANING AND USE OF DELTA-14C AND DELTA-14C IN OCEANOGRAPHY
                                         by
                                  H. Göte Östlund
                   Tritium Laboratory, RSMAS, University of Miami
     
     
     Summary  OOPS! Don't use delta-14C for calculating quantity of 14C.
     
     
     ARGUMENT delta
     
     Beta counting of 14C produces results in form of count rates, which can 
     be converted to the relative specific activity r of the sample defined 
     by
     
        r = Asx/Ast = Isx/Ist                                              (1)
     
     where Ast is the adjusted specific activity of the NBS oxalic acid 14C 
     standard, 13.56 dpm/g of carbon, and Asx is the specific activity of the 
     sample in dpm/g.  By applying the decay rate of 14C this ratio can also be 
     expressed in isotope 14C/Ctot-abundance ratios I, where Ist is 1.176 - 10-12. 
     Often a 'per mil deviation', delta-14C is calculated according to
     
        delta-14C = 1000 · (r - 1)                                         (2)
     
     See Remark.
     
     Assuming that isotope fractionation is negligible during sample 
     preparation, the r-value (and thereby the delta-14C) is the proper 
     parameter to use for computing the absolute, true quantity of 14C as 
     number of atoms or moles. Thus the amount of 14C in moles, in a kg of 
     seawater or air is
     
                             -12
        SIGMA-14C = 1.176 - 10   · r · SIGMA                               (3)
     
     where SIGMA-C is the absolute assay of carbon in moles/kg.  Mass inventories 
     of 14C, as well as macroscopic mixing and transports by currents and 
     turbulent diffusion call for the use of Eq 3.  If there is fractionation 
     during collection and processing of a sample, the true, original r-value 
     can be calculated from the sample r-value if delta-13C data are available 
     for both.  By experience the standard ship-board C02 extraction from 
     seawater and laboratory processing cause isotope shifts that are less 
     than 0.5‰ and thus insignificant.
     
     
     ARGUMENT DELTA: 
     
     By (an unfortunate) convention environmental 14C data are usually 
     expressed as DELTA-14C or R according to
     
        DELTA-14C = delta-14C - 2 (delta-13C + 25) · (1 + 0.001delta-14C)  (4)
        R = 1 + 0. 001.DELTA-14C                                           (5)
     
     These equations describe what the 14C/Ctot isotope ratio would be if a
     hypothetical chemical fractionation  process brings the delta-13C value 
     from its actual value to -25 per mil.
     
     The use of the DELTA-14C and R is a carry-over from the radiocarbon 
     dating procedures, where isotope fractionation in the biological cycle 
     necessitates this correction to allow calculation of best 'radiocarbon 
     age' of a sample, most often organic material. The delta-13C reference 
     value -25 was originally chosen as standard value, being typical for 
     terrestrial wood, first used for 14C standard material.
     
     In geochemical considerations, conversion to DELTA-14C is needed for 
     calculations of "mummy" ages and for the proper handling of chemical 
     equilibria, rate of chemical reactions and phase transfers. Examples:
     
          Mummy age = (-ln R) / lambda           years before AD 1950.
     
                                           -1
     where lambda is 14C decay rate in years
     
     In air-sea exchange of 14C02, assume Pair and Pdia are partial pressures 
     of atmospheric and dissolved C02 and Rair and Rdis the isotope adjusted 
     R-values according to Eq. 5, then there should be chemical equilibrium 
     (no net transport) of 14C02 if
     
          Pair Rair - Pdis Rdis
     
     
     
     CONCLUSION: 
     
     The r-values (delta-14C) are needed for use in the calculation of mass 
     of 14C. If only DELTA-14C values are available, this is accomplished by 
     solving for r in the equations 5,4 and 2 above and putting the value into 
     Eq 3.  With some approximation:
     
          Oceanic dissolved C02     delta-13C =   0.0  r = 1.050 R
          Atmospheric C02           delta-13C = - 8.5  r = 1.033 R
          Wood (cellulose)          delta-13C = -25    r = 1.000 R
     
     The factors in column 3, above express the errors obtained in 14C 
     inventories if DELTA-14C, or R, is used instead of delta-14C, or r.
     
     When one compares 14C in various parts of the ocean, a systematic error 
     of 5% may be insignificant. Also measured transfer coefficients have 
     larger uncertainties than 5%. However, include a production term for 14C 
     (cosmic, industrial), or the atmospheric inventory, and there is cause 
     for concern.
     
     
     
     REMARK
     
     In the exhaustive, maybe exhausting, paper by Stuiver and Polach
     (1977) delt-14C is indeed defined accurately and properly, with age
     corrections of standard material activity to AD 1950, and for the
     time elapsed between collection and measurement of the unknown
     sample. It is the first equation (un-numbered) on pg. 361 in that
     paper. The activity and isotope ratio values of the NBS oxalic acid
     standard are listed in several papers, among them one by Stuiver et
     al, (1981), viz pg. 208. The inventory equation on that page should
     use delta-14C , not DELTA-14C.
     
     
     
     POSTSCRIPT:
     
     This error was pointed out in a recent paper by Bard et al, (1988), and 
     is discussed by Östlund and Rooth (1990), as well as by Lassey (1989). 
     In this pioneering paper on global 14C, Craig (1957), correctly used the 
     unadjusted r-values, and so did Kuc (1986 and 1987) on atmospheric 14C 
     inventories. Most often, however, DELTA-14C is erroneously used for 
     absolute quantities of 14C.

                 1. Generated new SUMMARY file from final SIO/ODF data. Now 
                    has Uncorrected as well as Corrected Bottom Depths,    
                    corrected EVENT CODEs, NAV, Height ABOVE BOTTOM, WIRE OUT,

                    Sample Log Sheets and COMMENTS from ODF Station and Cast 
                    Description. Neodynium was not included since it does not 
                    have a parameter number. Particulates were not included 
                    since the documentation does not say whether they were 
                    parameter number 40 or 41 (or both). 
                 2. Generated new SEA file from final SIO/ODF data. Now has 
                    BTLNBRs, complete CTDSAL and more decimal places in data. 
                    ODF did not include CTDOXY with bottle data in pre-woce 
                    cruises so it is not available for this report. Oxygen is 
                    included with the CTD data. 
                 3. Merged final CFC data received from Peter Salameh April 3, 
                      2001/usr/export/html-public/data/onetime/atlantic/a16/
                        original/A16_SAVE_CFC/save5.txt 
                    into the new SEA file, replacing the shipboard CFCs in the 
                    ODF data. 

     04/16/01  Muus         CFCs       Reformatted by WHPO
               The modified a16c and a16s data are in ~dave/SDIGGS/A16.  I 
                 was wrong in my April 3rd message assuming the .SEA files 
                 were from ODF. They look more like they were generated from 
                 .sd2 files.  I redid everything from the final ODF data: .SUM 
                 files, .SEA files for rosette and .SEA files for large volume 
                 samplers.  Freons were collected from the piggyback Niskins 
                 on many of the Large Volume casts.  Many of the CFCs have 
                 quality codes of 6 meaning they are averages of replicate 
                 samples. The WOCE instructions say the details on the 
                 replicates should be in the documentation. I haven't seen any 
                 such documentation, could it be in the original CFC data 
                 directory in "a16_save_cfc.mail"?  The read permission is 
                 'owner only'.
               We do not have any of the actual large volume data 
                 (c14, argon-39, krypton, radium 228 & 226). The new files 
                 included them in the .SUM parameters but do not have any 
                 headers in the .SEA files.
               Successfully ran sumchk and wocecvt.
               Please let me know if you have any questions or need further 
                 clarification.

               The PIs for C14 during SAVE/HYDROS were Broecker/Ostlund. 
               The summary table shows No Data for A16C or A16S. I can 
               provide copies of the LV files for all of SAVE/HYDROS if you 
               do not have. I do not have Jenkin's (not Smethie) H3/He3 data

               Replaced both the SUM and BOTTLE files online with the ones 
               with CFC values (Muus 20010416). Also placed LVS file online, 
               produced EXCHANGE file and placed on website. EXCHANGE file

               I uploaded the SAVE+HYDROS LV files today using your form. 
               Note that a bottle number of "99" is a surface sample 
               obtained without using a Gerard barrel. The file I sent does 
               NOT have the piggyback niskin bottles. The only way I have 
               that information is in a merged ascii file with "everything". 
               This merged file does not have flags and is closer to the 
               original files sent out by ODF + merged data I recieved from 
               individual investigators. I have attached a copy of this file 
               "just in case". The attached file is in an shortened format, 
               but your guys won't have any trouble doing a reformat.

               April 16, 2003
               A. Kozyr noted that the carbon data for a16s was not in the 
                 online file. (See e-mail above)
               Since the file he sent only had station number and bottle 
                 number to use for merging, I retrieved the a16s carbon data 
                 from his web site.
