## Summary of GFDL ESM2Mc age-oxygen correlation analysis

###### Objective:
Determine the relationship between oceanic age and oxygen in the control model simulation.
Goal is to use this relationship to examine the observed change in Southern Ocean
age and test the observed change in oxygen.

###### Methods:
Used annual averaged age and oxygen from GFDL ESM2Mc. Calculated the Pearson
correlation coefficient on two density surface ($\sigma_{\theta}$ = 26 and 27.2).
Also calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient on various longitude transects
corresponding to relevant repeat hydrography sections (see figures 1 and 2).

###### Results:
Analysis of age-oxygen correlation on density surface 26 (intermediate water)
shows a largely negative relationship (Figure 3). Only small regions with positive
correlation seem to align with well-known upwelling regions. Analysis of age-oxygen
correlation on density surface 27.2 (deep water) agains shows largely negative relationship
but with broader regions of positive relationship in the Southern Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean.
